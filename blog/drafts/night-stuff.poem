Out of the corner of my eye I saw it
A bright and shiny thing
Movement in the dark of night
Gone just out of sight.

Sprawling over the sheets a body
Naked white flesh on top a body
The smell of cum and sweat of a body
Turning over twisting unseeing.

I pulled back a blanket overtop
In the dark
Not a stranger to be found
The room twisting all around.
