Two found the castle ‖ and petitioned the dragon at
his court ‖ where the beast crouched atop his horde of gold 

Lord Mammon ‖ by right of property and on appeal to your convictions?
Might you gift the ring I should inherit?

I know justice. I know mercy
These are the gods that men pray to in my presence!

And there is none, none that not fade away ‖ Yes!
All men all ‖ decay and die, the dragon's horde

Being just ‖ This earthly dust, the dross of man
This golden horde, the skulls of dead

What's earthly wealth in Hell ‖ is your head!
What should I care for mortal men and mercy?

But I always hunger more… A trade is due.

You ought to lose a heart to make a body whole
Take the ring and lose your heart
Keep your heart and lose your soul

So take this ring then ‖ this too shall pass
Always will mortal's ring ‖ slip away to me

By my father time, a weapon to surpass
All tanks and bombs and fears ‖ all these years

My horde is greater still than any mortal kings
For time makes all men afraid of golden rings!

And with a loud roaring of wind, our hero twisted
And tumbled across the harsh desert sands

Blown about and about and about and about
Singing and sighing and laughing and crying
