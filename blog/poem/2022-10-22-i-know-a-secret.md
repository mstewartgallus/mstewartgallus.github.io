- <q>I know a secret</q>
- the creature said
- He sat there on the cobblestones
- in the darkness, just out of sight
- of the yellow sodium light

+ We sat there for a while
+ Me on the bench, him by the sea
+ The wind not much
+ by the waterfront

- The creature spoke again

>
> * a few years back,
> * I was sitting not far from here
> * in the darkness, just out of sight
> * a man raped a girl under cover of the night


> - I know a secret,
> - for I see very well,
> - even under<Caesura />the night.
> - These eyes catch many things
> - I will never tell.

> + The truth came out
> + decades later at the trial
> + Your courts<Caesura />are not like ours
> + We have eyes<Caesura />which catch
> + The beating of the heart
> + Whispers<Caesura />inside the throat

> - I saw an old man ill and dying
> - too rich and sick for jail
> - When he was coughing sputum up
> - I was sitting there
> - I know a secret
> - and I will never tell
