{% poem %}
<q>I know a secret</q>
the creature said
He sat there on the cobblestones
in the darkness, just out of sight
of the yellow sodium light
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
We sat there for a while
Me on the bench, him by the sea
The wind not much
by the waterfront
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
The creature spoke again
{% endpoem %}

> {% poem %}
a few years back,
I was sitting not far from here
in the darkness, just out of sight
a man raped a girl under cover of the night
{% endpoem %}
>
> {% poem %}
I know a secret,
for I see very well,
even under ‖ the night.
These eyes catch many things
I will never tell.
{% endpoem %}
> 
> {% poem %}
The truth came out
decades later at the trial
Your courts ‖ are not like ours
We have eyes ‖ which catch
The beating of the heart
Whispers ‖ inside the throat
{% endpoem %}

> {% poem %}
I saw an old man ill and dying
too rich and sick for jail
When he was coughing sputum up
I was sitting there
I know a secret
and I will never tell
{% endpoem %}
