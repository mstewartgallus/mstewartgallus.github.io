Hunter, hunter ‖ I hunt for one like thee
Hunter, hunter ‖ why have you wounded me?
Hunter, hunter ‖ so strong and fair
You surpass Eros in dread accuracy

Hunter, hunter ‖ where are your painless arrows?
Hunter, hunter ‖ I dream to hunt for gallows
Hunter, hunter ‖ of wild lands
The hunt has hunted me through straits and narrows

Hunter, hunter ‖ can you find my path?
Hunter, hunter ‖ through woods and thorns
Hunter, hunter ‖ of the silver moon
a stag implores you gut by its own horns
