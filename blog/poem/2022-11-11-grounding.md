{% poem %}
A lamp hanging over head
The overcast sky outside
The felt cap across the desk
A man in the seat aside across from me
The clock 9:19 an hour behind
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
Paper scrunching, crackling
Fans, the AC? humming
Keypresses tapping

The textured chiclet keyboard
On my wrist, smooth greenwood beads
Soft dry socks warm my feet

Coffee stale on my tongue
{% endpoem %}
