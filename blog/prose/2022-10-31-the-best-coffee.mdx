The best coffee in Vancouver is a matter of taste. However, the best
coffee per dollar is objective fact.

The problem with chain fast food coffee is not poor quality but rather
inconsistency.  Despite guidelines otherwise I assume it is likely
many coffee machines are unwashed for days or many pots of coffee are
kept stale on warm for hours.

So timing and location are key. Depending on the shift and the volume
of customers you may or may not obtain a fresh cup of coffee. Never
order decaf. I assume the employees must spit it in it or something.

The other side of coffee is psychological and internal to the
self. Coffee can be tough on the stomach and should be consumed in
small quantities along with a small amount of some bread stuff. But
moreover, time of day and relative thirst or hunger plays a role as
well.  The best coffee is consumed early in the morning along with the
thick fog of a headache.

Setting and weather are critical as well. The best coffee is drunk in
a warm comfortable quiet place and at the same time under an umbrella
during the rain in a park. Both are key ingredients. The best coffee
requires walking.

There are a few locations in Vancouver near a nice park and near a
quiet place with good internet access like a public library. Some
pleasant locations to look around from include the central library and
the sea wall.

Unfortunately such matters are also predicated on time. Nothing is
constant and especially not coffee. Coffee is more of a feel or matter
of experience for certain locations and times than for research.

I will not share my favorite locations. Small grimy places, a few
chains, a few hipster places you can look up on any review blog of
coffee in Vancouver. I do not want you to spoil the atmosphere and I
hate you and wish you a bad day.

If you really must try circling out from some skate parks or
underneath highway overpasses.
