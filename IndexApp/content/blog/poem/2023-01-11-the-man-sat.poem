The drunkard sat
No he's not drunk ‖ that's the problem he's got.

The man sat ‖ cold and stiff
He pulled a cup to his lips.

His hair was well kempt  ‖ his demeanor ‖ calm
He was not drunk ‖ and he drunk on and on.

He had good shoes ‖ his pants were not old and faded ‖ clearly someone cared
The man sat and drank ‖ and he stared.

His face did not look aged or sick
Only blue eyes ‖ he drank ‖ it did not stick.
