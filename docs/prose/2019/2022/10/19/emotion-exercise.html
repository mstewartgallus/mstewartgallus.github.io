    <p>I feel a great heaviness about my eyes and tension is jamming needles in my jaw.
<br />My arms are all itchy red and swollen up and tension crushes the muscles of my back together.
<br />The ground beneath my feet is very heavy and weighs down on me so much.
<br />My gut grinds together and my burning parched throat chokes itself.
</p><p>I have a bit of a sinus headache and my face is itchy all over.
<br />My legs itch, my arms itch, my body itches, my face itches.
<br />I feel despondent, glum.
</p><p>I feel very ugly inside and out.
</p><p>I breathe shallowly with a racing heartbeat.
<br />I don't know when the tiredness will ever leave my eyes.
</p><p>The tendons of my forearms are tense, my shoulders are tense, my whole body is tensed.</p>
