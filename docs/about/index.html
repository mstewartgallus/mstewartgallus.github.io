    <h3 id="hi-there">Hi there</h3>

<p>My name is Molly Stewart-Gallus but my pen name is Molossus Spondee.
This is my personal blog mostly for posting silly poetry.</p>

<p>I guess right now I’m just working on my portfolio.</p>

<p>I have personal interests in formal methods but mostly have
professional experience in web development. I’m most looking for
stability and flexible work hours in job positions.</p>

<h3 id="im-looking-for">I’m looking for</h3>

<p>I have a personal interest in formal methods but mostly have
professional experience in web development, system administration,
advertising and analytics.  I would strongly value flexible work hours
or part time positions and would also prioritise stability and
work-life balance.  I don’t want to go home on Friday and get a call
on the weekend that something is broken.</p>

<h3 id="im-currently-learning">I’m currently learning</h3>

<p>Lately I’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/category-fun">formalizing a small amount of category
theory</a> in
<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a>.</p>

<p>I’m playing around with type systems and formal methods right now and
I’m hopeful category theory can help with this.  I’ve been trying to
figure out how to make internal languages for many types of
categories. <a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/doublecatrel">I’ve
started</a> on some ideas
to work within double categories like Rel.</p>

<p>I have a hunch you can generalize graded monads and adjoint functors
for a sort of graded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call-by-push-value">Call By Push
Value</a> which ought
to be useful for a compiler IR to simplify optimization.</p>

<p>I got heavily into <a href="http://nlab-pages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nlab/show/category+theory#idea">category
theory</a>
for a while. I am no longer convinced it is so simple to compile
computer programs to a categorical intermediate representation.  But a
start of an effort towards this might be <a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/prologish">this
project</a> which compiles a
continuations based language to co-closed categories in a manner dual
to compiling the STLC to closed categories.  Basically it’s dual to
the paper <a href="http://conal.net/papers/compiling-to-categories/">Compiling to
categories</a> by Conal
Elliott.  I also found tagless final style is very clean for
parametric higher order abstract syntax.</p>

<p>I have found category theory very interesting although it does have
some weaknesses with respect to variable binding and higher category
theory.  Category theory tends towards a very combinatorial sort of
style which makes some things very verbose that would be much clearer
with name binders.  Unfortunately parametric foundations allowing
manipulation of name binders are kind of complicated.  The other big
hurdle with category theory is higher categories: categories of
categories.  Very quickly higher category theory gets messy to play
around with in an actual theorem prover.  I’m not sure if these
problems are fundamental or someone smarter than me can come up with
solutions.</p>

<h3 id="in-the-past">In the past</h3>

<p>I’ve also been playing with technologies like <a href="https://redex.racket-lang.org/">PLT
Redex</a> and
<a href="http://astampoulis.github.io/makam/">Makam</a> (a dialect of <a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~dale/lProlog/">Lambda
Prolog</a>) for rapid
prototyping of programming language interpreters.</p>

<p>You can see a tiny demo language in PLT Redex
<a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/playground/blob/master/coexp.rkt">here</a></p>

<p>A little language in Makam
<a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/coc-makam">here</a> . Makam works
great for simply typed languages but full dependent types are <strong>way
too</strong> complicated in any implementation.</p>

<p>I got interested in compilers and interpreters for a while. I played a
bit with effect systems like Call-By-Push-Value (basically ANF) and
simple functional optimizations:
<a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/hs-callbypushvalue">https://github.com/mstewartgallus/hs-callbypushvalue</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/compiler-2">https://github.com/mstewartgallus/compiler-2</a></p>

<p>I also played a <a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/peacod">little bit</a>
with <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a> but I found it too
complicated for initial experimentation.  Also GraalVM had troubles
with tail recursion at the time which made it hard to implement
functional languages.  <a href="https://github.com/ekmett/cadenza">Cadenza</a>
for example went through hoops I didn’t want to bother with to
optimize tail calls.</p>

<p>I got heavily into low-level details of the JVM for a while.  I
learned to <a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/heaps">use</a>
<a href="https://bytebuddy.net/">ByteBuddy</a> and
<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/understanding-java-method-invocation-with-invokedynamic">invokedynamic</a>
to insert dynamically optimizable spots into a Java program.</p>

<p>I got heavily into lock-free programming for a while and
<a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/stacklock">played</a> with making a
more efficient unfair lock implementation based on MCS Locks that uses
a stack instead of a queue. I also tried formalizing a little bit of
it in <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/high-level-view.html">TLA+</a>.</p>

<p>In the past I got into hard real-time and safety critical stuff for a
while. I
<a href="https://github.com/mstewartgallus/linted/tree/master">experimented</a>
with breaking a program into separate processes some of which are
verifiable in a safe dialect of <a href="https://www.adacore.com/about-spark">Ada
SPARK</a>. The lock-free queue is
probably broken.  I didn’t really get how Ada SPARK was meant to
handle concurrency.</p>
