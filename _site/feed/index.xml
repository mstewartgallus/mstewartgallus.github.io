    <content type="html"><p><q>Any peanut allergies?</q> I say.</p>

<p><q>It’s a mild anxiolytic.  The sesame seed oil suspension can cause
an allergic reaction</q> I explain.</p>

<p><q>It calms nerves</q> I say to the blank stare of the frightened
woman in front of me.  It also was an amnestic although she didn’t
need to know that.</p>

<p><q>We think you were mugged</q>.  We being the cleanup crew who
handled things after an incident was over.</p>

<p>I pull out a pen light and check her eyes for a concussion.</p>

<p><q>Damnit what’s first aid?</q> I don’t say out loud.</p>

<p>I phone up a local taxi company in front of the woman.  I hold her
hand and wait with her for 15 minutes or so.  Luckily, we were in the
downtown core.</p>

<p><q>Fucking cowboys.</q></p>

<hr />

<p>Later, I drink some tea at a coffee shop and decompress a bit.  I had
time to kill before the site director arrived for an interview.
Maybe, I could get a bit of sugar and caffeine in.  I haven’t slept
for two nights so I needed the kick.</p>

<p>I browse social media for half an hour and nibble on a chocolate chip
cookie.  I put my phone on <q>do not disturb.</q> My coworkers are
spamming the company chat with the usual garbage.</p>

<p>I begin to plot the murder of my supervisor.</p>

<ul class="greentext" role="presentation">
  <li>be me</li>
  <li>be born in Vancouver</li>
  <li>high cost of living</li>
  <li>dirt poor</li>
  <li>second son of the family</li>
  <li>my dad was a failed starving artist</li>
  <li>my mother worked at data entry at a bank</li>
  <li>she was fat with a broken back</li>
  <li>and at home they didn’t do much but eat and watch TV</li>
  <li>I mostly grew up alone on books and the computer</li>
  <li>at school I was never really bullied</li>
  <li>I’d come home and my parents would ask</li>
  <li>Were you bullied today at school?</li>
  <li>Nothing happened at school</li>
  <li>I just hid behind the back at lunch and did nothing</li>
  <li>all of my life just nothing</li>
  <li>I got a job below my skills and paid my way through college</li>
  <li>but the rage ate away at me</li>
  <li>I would walk along the streets for hours</li>
  <li>just walking away the rage</li>
  <li>I had violent and suicidal and sexual and jealous thoughts</li>
  <li>I began to suffer at college</li>
  <li>I sat in a haze at the library through exams for courses I hadn’t been to all semester</li>
  <li>but I pushed through</li>
  <li>I got an Associate’s Degree in <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr></li>
  <li>I worked part time 10 hours a week</li>
  <li>barely</li>
  <li>are a job that didn’t really use my skills</li>
  <li>at night I would feel like I was choking on the smell of burning garbage</li>
  <li>so I would go for long walks</li>
  <li>I started writing poetry</li>
  <li>just sitting at the library and writing poetry all day</li>
  <li>I developed weird pains through out my body</li>
  <li>I always had body issues</li>
  <li>and when I was 24 I got badly sunburned</li>
  <li>I freaked out and went to the emergency room</li>
  <li>fully convinced I was dying of skin cancer</li>
  <li>I kept going on in a fog</li>
  <li>in pain and suicidal everyday</li>
  <li>I was convinced my face was swelling up oddly</li>
  <li>it was round about a year after that</li>
  <li>I began meditating</li>
  <li>and it really saved my life</li>
  <li>I became really accomplished</li>
  <li>I meditated a lot</li>
  <li>I had to because I was in so much pain</li>
  <li>but soon the choking rage came back</li>
  <li>eventually I bought a skirt</li>
  <li>and it was when I put it on I had to admit I was trans</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s no conclusion here except maybe things didn’t have to be like
this and you don’t really know what handicaps people are struggling
with just by looking at their skin or apparent gender and I don’t
really believe in bad guys and punishment anymore. When you’ve been to
that point where you’re a danger to yourself and others you know it’s
already punishment enough.</p>

<p>Things are getting better. I’m working more. I hope I’ll be able to
get a job making real use of my coding skills eventually.</p>

    <content type="html"><p>I rotate up to a 45° angle.  Head on the ground legs in the air.</p>

<p>It is a cool dark evening and I am safe and sheltered in my warm
winter coat.  I am in the park near the highway.  I hear the traffic
rumble in the distance.  Nearby a crow pecks at a stick and hops
around cawwing.</p>

<p>Rotations done for the day I head home.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is sometime after bedtime and I am awake under warm heavy weighted
blankets.</p>

<p>A coppery taste comes up from my throat.  I ponder taking a vegetable
peeler to my flesh.  My legs bend back at the hips at a 90° angle.  I
am a worm.  I pull at my face nuzzling my cheeks against my hands my
soft squishy flesh comforting in sensory feeling.  Between my false
ribs throbs a dull ache.</p>

<hr />

<p>I wake up at 1:00 <abbr title="Ante Meridiem">AM</abbr> with my cock twitching and my nipples
aching.  I masturbate to fantasies of being tied up, forced femmed,
put in latex and groped and raped.</p>

<p>This morning I feel like the dried crust at the bottom of an unwashed
coffee cup.  I reach over to my phone on my the desk beside my bed to
look for some of my favorite porn.  It is 10:09 <abbr title="Ante Meridiem">AM</abbr> and I have a
dentist appointment soon.</p>

<p><q>Ah fuck!</q></p>

<p>I struggle out of my floral jam jams and into a pair of deep blue
jeans.  I pull on a long sleeved red shirt and pick up my morning meds
and rush out the bedroom to the door.  On the way hurrying to the bus
stop I phone the dentist.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the way to the coffee shop it seems as if those around me are
puppets moving all stiff and herky-jerky.  The yellow crane in a
nearby building under construction becomes a little toy.  Toy cars and
toy houses and toy people.</p>

<p>I take a shit in the coffee shop after talking to a cute girl.</p>

Most markup navigates awkwardly, does not insert appropriate pauses
for breath, and mispronounces stress and sounds.  Consider
<a href="#markupa"><cite>Markup A</cite></a> and <a href="#markupb"><cite>Markup
B</cite></a>.  In <a href="#markupa"><cite>Markup A</cite></a> a poem is
an ordered list of stanzas and stanzas are ordered lists of verses.
In <a href="#markupb"><cite>Markup B</cite></a> poems are sequences of stanzas,
stanzas are paragraphs and lines in a paragraph are separated by line
break elements.</p>

  <p>As a <i>nuclear</i> solution you can markup the text for graphical
display using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">graphic</code> role as in <a href="#markupn"><cite>Markup
N</cite></a>.  I advise use of the <s><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-labelledby</code></s> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-details</code>
(2022-11-28) attribute instead of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-label</code> attribute
here. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-label</code> has a tendency to work poorly with newlines in
text, is not usually translated by automated tools and doesn’t let you
embed more markup as appropriate.</p>

  <p>In some setups <a href="#markupb"><cite>Markup B</cite></a> sounds yucky.  Ending
and starting words in separate lines like <i>red</i> and
<i>Violets</i> run together.  You might include extra punctuation
annotated with a screen-reader-only class as with <a href="#markupb2"><cite>Markup
A’</cite></a> and <a href="#markupb3"><cite>Markup B’ <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></cite></a> to work around this issue.
However, on Firefox this hack breaks up lines into separate areas to
track through.</p>

  <p>No revisions of <a href="#markupa"><cite>Markup A</cite></a> or <a href="#markupb"><cite>Markup B</cite></a> ensure
proper pronunciation of stress and sounds.  Only American English is
likely to be pronounced correctly. To help, you can set the language
attribute for documents and poems as appropriate.  However, this is
not a complete solution.</p>

  <p>As an anglophone Canadian author I set the language attribute for my
documents and poems to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">en-CA</code>. However, this only helps with English
words and not with imports from other languages.  I don’t know how to
help screen readers pronounce names of mythical figures.  You could
markup individual phrases like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;i lang="non"&gt;Sleipnir&lt;/i&gt;</code> (old
Norse) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;i lang="gem"&gt;Wotan&lt;/i&gt;</code> (Germanic languages group) but
this particular markup doesn’t help.</p>

  <p>Semantically you might markup stress with emphasis with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code>
element.  However, such markup is verbose and many screen readers
ignore elements like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> because of the heavy unsemantic abuse of
such elements in the wider internet for presenting bold text.</p>

  <p>Perhaps there might be some obscure Unicode diacritics for better
marking up the prosody but I have not explored this option.  I worry
that such glyphs might be pronounced in common screen readers as
something like <q>Unicode character 591</q>.</p>

  <p>Laying out poetry on small formats is awkward.  In print the standard
layout for overlong lines is to align the first line ragged right and
all other lines ragged left.</p>

  <p>You can approximate a poetry layout with a hanging indent layout
something like <a href="#indentcss"><cite>Indent <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></cite></a>.  However, a
hanging indent layout is not really correct.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>You can approximate a poetry layout on the web by aligning every line
block to the left but aligning the last line of the text <em>within</em> the
line block to the right.  Something like <a href="#alignlastcss"><cite>Align Last
<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></cite></a> almost works for a poetry layout.  However,
even this layout fails when you overflow multiple lines.</p>

    <content type="html"><p>My name is Silk and I am a hamster. I am a woman and I have pale cream
colored fur. Being a hamster I am a solitary sort but I actually like
my owner. The only thing is I wish my owner and her lover wouldn’t
have such loud and annoying sex.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard a woman scream <q>scootaloo</q> during an orgasm? Or
hear your owner poke her lover’s tits for ten minutes straight saying
beep, boop, beep boop?</p>

<p>Today I was curled up in my little coconut shell closet nibbling on a
lightly fermented pumpkin seed while my owner and her lover were
having dinner. They were having spaghetti with ground beef. I had a
craving for mealworms but all I had were seeds.</p>

<p><q>Quick cover Silk’s eyes</q> my owner yelled and I knew I was in trouble.</p>

<p>A quick peek out of my hut and it seemed as if my owner had spilled
spaghetti across her lover’s prodigious chest but in the process of
mopping things up had entangled themselves onto the floor. Whereupon
my owner’s lover proceeded to mime playing a guitar while stroking my
owner’s clit.</p>

<p><q>rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum</q> my owner sung to the tune of
<q>Little Drummer Boy</q> while miming playing bongos with her lover’s
chest.</p>

    <content type="html"><p>The best coffee in Vancouver is a matter of taste. However, the best
coffee per dollar is objective fact.</p>

<p>The problem with chain fast food coffee is not poor quality but rather
inconsistency.  Despite guidelines otherwise I assume it is likely
many coffee machines are unwashed for days or many pots of coffee are
kept stale on warm for hours.</p>

<p>So timing and location are key. Depending on the shift and the volume
of customers you may or may not obtain a fresh cup of coffee. Never
order decaf. I assume the employees must spit it in it or something.</p>

<p>The other side of coffee is psychological and internal to the
self. Coffee can be tough on the stomach and should be consumed in
small quantities along with a small amount of some bread stuff. But
moreover, time of day and relative thirst or hunger plays a role as
well.  The best coffee is consumed early in the morning along with the
thick fog of a headache.</p>

<p>Setting and weather are critical as well. The best coffee is drunk in
a warm comfortable quiet place and at the same time under an umbrella
during the rain in a park. Both are key ingredients. The best coffee
requires walking.</p>

<p>There are a few locations in Vancouver near a nice park and near a
quiet place with good internet access like a public library. Some
pleasant locations to look around from include the central library and
the sea wall.</p>

<p>Unfortunately such matters are also predicated on time. Nothing is
constant and especially not coffee. Coffee is more of a feel or matter
of experience for certain locations and times than for research.</p>

<p>I will not share my favorite locations. Small grimy places, a few
chains, a few hipster places you can look up on any review blog of
coffee in Vancouver. I do not want you to spoil the atmosphere and I
hate you and wish you a bad day.</p>

<p>If you really must try circling out from some skate parks or
underneath highway overpasses.</p>

    <content type="html"><p>Like a pug in an oxygen mask I lied down on the carpet by the air
purifier and shitposted away on the internet.  My Saint Sebastian
ex-gay thread had sparked an 80 page debate on the political forum I
frequented and I had to see the madness through.</p>

<p>Besides some idiot had got bent into a rant.</p>

<p><q>You have no power here</q> I replied.  And then again <q>I’m already dead
anyway pretty much</q></p>

<p>She replied <q>ok</q>.</p>

<p>I checked back every hour or so but she seemed to have stopped
replying even to my colorful image suggesting she was transgender.</p>

<p>So I returned to the routine.  Afraid I might grind my fingers in the
coffee grinder I opened the drawer it was kept in and checked it was
safely unplugged and stored away.  I stared up at the popcorn ceiling
breathless and watched little technicolor squiggles swirl around until
I fell asleep.</p>

<hr />

<p>The supernatural intruded slowly.</p>

<p>The first night when I was wanking away at 12 <abbr title="Ante Meridiem">AM</abbr> imagining my ass
being penetrated I heard a loud buzzing sound like wasps.  I put it
down to nerves.</p>

<p>Steadily the phenomenon added up.  A loud hum at the midnight hours.
When I rested before bed a sound like bells.  When I looked out one
eye a hue of colors different from the other.</p>

<p>On Thursday during my morning commute to the library where I do
nothing in particular I was met with the sudden urge to fling myself
off a highway overpass into the traffic below.  It was as if some worm
wrapped around my brain had contracted and struck me with itching pain
and a feeling of doom.  I changed my commute to avoid overpasses and
bridges.</p>

<hr />

<p>She sent me a message during the night.</p>

<p>I woke up with a heavy weight pinning me in place.  A roiling darkness
sat on my chest.  I tried to move or call for help but could not.</p>

<p>The darkness said her name was Must.</p>

<p>She said she had planned to kill me but upon seeing how pathetic I was
decided to spare me and had decided to make my life a living hell
instead.</p>

<p>She explained I was her thrall now and that hell was both a physical
place and a state of mind.  Identity was a matter of perspective.  If
she could walk to me she would be me and if I could walk to her I
would be her.</p>

<p>For the rest of the night I drifted in and out of sleep.  Each time I
woke up I felt Must on top of me watching.  Until the morning sun
appeared when I woke up and the presence was gone completely.</p>

<hr />

<p>Must had bent the day against me.  I was exhausted unable to breathe
or rest.  Moreover, as if by some illusion stripped away the people
around me had transformed into puppeted corpses.  Every trivial
interaction became an ordeal and I could no longer draw strength or
comfort from those who I had considered friends.  I could not bear to
meet the hideous gazes of those around me.</p>

<p>During the night I was compelled to roam by a manic energy.  I felt
hot ash drawn into my chest when I was trying to sleep and cool relief
when I walked the night.  It is oddly calming during the midnight
hours when there is no traffic or human face to fear.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first task Must demanded of me was to hide the vanity of my flesh.</p>

<p>If I was good the pain would lessen although never go away entirely.
If I was bad the pain would increase.</p>

<p>One of the numerous punishments meted out to me was a sudden stabbing
pain in a mole on my scrotum.  By this sudden intrusion into my life I
was made to rush to the bathroom to check if my junk was ok or at
urgent times to fondle myself in public.  Fear of this public
humiliation alienated myself further and I no longer attended events
hosted by my friends.</p>

<p>I soon remained covered up at all times in long baggy sweaters and
pants.  I went to great lengths to avoid my appearance and even took
baths in the dark.</p>

<hr />

<p>For a few months there were no further demands.  Still the pain
continued and I fell even further into a state of fog.</p>

<p>As a result of the constant pains administered to me I had grown
desensitized in my crotch.  A curious numbness developed much like a
newly killed tooth.</p>

<p>Among other punishments Must had started to insert steel needles into
my arms during the night.  Shaving my arms near raw seemed to blunt
the pain a little somehow.  So I folded shaving my body hair into my
daily routine.</p>

<hr />

<p>To cope with the pain and suicidal ideations I developed an intense
practise of meditation.  I found it easiest to get started with the
book Meditation in Plain English and meditating lying on the ground.
I soon bought a zafu, a meditation mat, a meditation bench, a mala
bead braclet and necklace and a small Buddha statue for a personal
altar.</p>

<p>My usual practice consisted of a small amount of yoga such as standing
tree pose to wake myself up and then proceeded to basic box breathing
for a few minutes to calm myself down.  Once sufficiently energized
and rested I meditated on my solar plexus and in rhythm subvocalized a
dharani (I preferred Om Shanti Shanti Shanti.)  My preferred
meditation position being easy pose although sometimes I found using a
meditation bench less straining.</p>

<p>None of these trappings were really necessary of course.  If you
remember summer break lying on bed doing nothing just watching the
blanket rise and fall with your breath then that is meditation.</p>

<p>The numinal is hard to explain in words.  Sometimes I felt as if I was
moving like I was falling through a storm or a vast pressure on top of
me as if I was buried beneath the earth or there was a flickering red,
black, yellow vast expanse behind my closed eyelids.</p>

<p>I thought for a while I was free of Must.</p>

    <content type="html"><p>So I was idly browsing social media and hugging my blahaj in bed when
I saw my mutuals’ post doing numbers on gacc/gock.</p>

<p>gacc/gock</p>

<p>The social media app for transbians by transbians. Clone an existing
app but for a niche subgroup like college students or mentally ill men
in dresses. Then expand. Or given the predilections of those on the
platform inflate.</p>

<p>The eternal recurrence. If a demon appeared before you and told you
<q>all that was shall be again</q> would you cringe or declare
yourself a God? The Nietzschean ubermensch is here and she is a
lolcow.</p>

<p>So I was staring at a time lapse of my friend’s supernumerary butt
hole, an abscess drained last month ago. I suppose this was what
Zhaungzhi meant by the pipes of heaven and earth. I had sworn a blood
oath to stay off the chats but I suppose one little peek couldn’t
hurt. The familiar cacophony overcame me as a vortex of fuck sucked me
in.</p>

<p>Typically I used a katana but the current meta favored a Mosin
Nagant. The dueling subprogram of the network was old, elegant and
endlessly broken. The latest patches only try to contain the worst of
the chaos. I should know as the maintainer.</p>

<p>The easiest way to find information is to get dirty. I hit the streets
and greedily scarfed down the cigarette butts and needles littered
about. Hey it’s VR they’re just bytes! Gradually I picked up an acrid
trail.</p>

<p>Amongst the usual forums I found a black mass with a leaking
stoma. Wendigo. I walked in chewing on one last cigarette butt.</p>

<p><q>Hey it’s a genuine exploit!</q> I explained. <q>They never intended
you to use cigarettes like this so it leaks metadata like crazy.</q></p>

<p>I took another drink of coffee. It didn’t wash the taste out of my
mouth but it helped to pretend it did.</p>

<p>Anon noted <q>uhuh I understood a bit of that.</q></p>

    <content type="html"><p>Ollie pulled down his long sleeved shirt and stared at his pasty dry
arms in the bathroom mirror. The moles were climbing along his
arm. One mole in particular was cracked and infected.</p>

<p>Ollie plugged the bathtub and turned off the lights. Ollie slowly
pulled himself into the bathtub and once seated turned on the
tap. Ollie twitched as fear gripped his heart like a tapeworm.</p>

<hr />

<p>I wake up late in the afternoon with a splitting
headache. <abbr>TMJ</abbr>, bad posture and too much time on the
internet. I swallow a Tylenol and pull myself out of bed. By sunset I
make it to the door. I throw on a large coat to hide my meagre gyno
and head out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ollie began the day’s ceremony of grinding coffee. Ollie unplugged the
coffee grinder. Ollie poured in the coffee beans. Ollie plugged in the
coffee grinder. Ollie thought about putting his fingers in the coffee
grinder. Ollie ground the coffee. Ollie unplugged the coffee
grinder. Ollie spotted left out scissors on the countertop. Ollie
thought about sticking the scissors in his eyes. Ollie put the
scissors away in the drawer beneath the countertop.</p>

<hr />

<p>Downtown, I sip a cup of coffee comatose in a chain coffee shop until
near midnight. It’s very quiet and there’s no traffic on the
street. You can walk across the road pretty freely and there’s a
pleasant feeling like soft cotton in your head.</p>

<p>In the dark in the bad parts of town out among the street people I
start to feel a little alive.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ollie took a cup of coffee and a slice of banana bread to the little
table in the hall outside the college library proper. Ollie crumpled
over his laptop and began to exorcise the images that dug like wasps
against his skull.</p>

<p><q>Earlier that day a man and a woman kissed in the park. I thought: I
should tackle the girl to the ground and I should smash her head
against the pavement and I should rape her.</q></p>

<hr />

<p>I take a shit in a public bathroom in Victory square. A massive
constipation coffee dump. The guy in the room watching everything
reminds me to flush. Fucker.</p>

<p>I walk home down through China town. I’m tall and keep away from those
roaming about at these hours. A deep anger keeps me moving on through
the cool air.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ollie rushed out of the classroom claiming he needed to go to the
toilet. Ollie’s balls hurt. Ollie’s balls hurt a lot. In the toilet
stall Ollie fiddled with his nuts. Balls in a rubber sack the cords
caught twisted burning.</p>

<hr />

<p>I make it home my legs all tired and the spite worked out a little. I
turn off the lights and lie down prone in bed under the covers and I
masturbate with my fist pressuring myself thinking of women and
cock. I touch my chest and I think of shiny goddesses.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ollie orgasmed face down grinding his hips against his bed and hand
and staining the sheets with clear fluid and a foul smell.</p>

    <content type="html"><p>Day 8 of no coffee, captains log</p>

<p>My body boils like a bubbling pot of pastrami noodles. The wet red
meat mess gravy of my brain congeals over the stove top. I am frying
eggs sunnyside up.  I close my eyes and aeons pass. I open my eyes and
it is another world.  I remember Tuesday fondly.</p>

<p>My head a pounding agony lying trapped beneath the embrace of my
oneitis and enfolded in the choking intoxication of a vape fiend’s
addiction in a closet sized apartment.</p>

<p>I sequester protein sequences deep inside my intestine. The warm wet
egg yolk dirtying my fine trimmed facial hair. Breakfast as usual is a
tense quiet affair.  We are not hopeful today.</p>

could even get a real girl sometime!</p>

<p>Chrome display cryocases of black hoodied models lined the room.</p>

<p>At the depot running the counter was a lateshit twinkhon sales model
in a black suit. I estimated about two more years of viable use. One
more year if used roughly.</p>

<p><q>We have a wide variety of models available dear</q></p>

<p><q>I don’t care. I want a youngshit <abbr title="Body dysmorphic disorder">BDD</abbr> passoid boymoder!</q></p>

<p><q>Quite the popular option lately but have you considered other
models?  The lateshit gigahon roastie has quite a dedicated
following.</q></p>

<p><q>I want a smol peepee girl boymoder not a toastie roastie!</q></p>

<p><q>Not every <abbr title="Body dysmorphic disorder">BDD</abbr> passoid is a youngshit you know? We have quite a few
luckshit twinkhon futchboys waiting for a good home. How many good boy
points do you even have dear? You’re looking for quite the expensive
option you know?</q></p>

<p>I leaned my big boned man padding over the counter.</p>

<p><q>I want a <abbr title="Body dysmorphic disorder">BDD</abbr> boymoder passoid small peepee girl</q> I said through
gritted teeth.</p>

<p>Omae was getting unwise.</p>

<p>I pulled out a bag of McDonald’s takeout from my voluminous
trenchcoat. All around the room models in their cryocases turned their
heads to look.</p>

<p><q>Oh honey, you’re a big boy! You wouldn’t dare cause an incident would
you?</q></p>

<p><q>You try me and these chicken nuggies show just how much of a big boy
I am</q></p>
