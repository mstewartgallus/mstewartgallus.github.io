    <p>I was flush with good boy points from a recent contract with mama so I
decided to treat myself. Mama said if I do well with a practice gf I
could even get a real girl sometime!</p>

<p>Chrome display cryocases of black hoodied models lined the room.</p>

<p>At the depot running the counter was a lateshit twinkhon sales model
in a black suit. I estimated about two more years of viable use. One
more year if used roughly.</p>

<p>“We have a wide variety of models available dear”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I want a youngshit BDD passoid boymoder!”</p>

<p>“Quite the popular option lately but have you considered other models?
The lateshit gigahon roastie has quite a dedicated following.”</p>

<p>“I want a smol pp girl boymoder not a toastie roastie!”</p>

<p>“Not every BDD passoid is a youngshit you know? We have quite a few
luckshit twinkhon futchboys waiting for a good home. How many good boy
points do you even have dear? You’re looking for quite the expensive
option you know?”</p>

<p>I leaned my big boned man padding over the counter.</p>

<p>“I WANT A BDD BOYMODER PASSOID SMALL PP GIRL” I said through gritted
teeth.</p>

<p>Omae was getting unwise.</p>

<p>I pulled out a bag of McDonald’s takeout from my voluminous
trenchcoat. All around the room models in their cryocases turned their
heads to look.</p>

<p>“Oh honey, you’re a big boy! You wouldn’t dare cause an incident would
you?”</p>

<p>“You try me and these chicken nuggies show just how much of a big boy
I am”</p>
