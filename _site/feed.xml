<ul class="greentext" role="presentation">
  <li>be me</li>
  <li>be born in Vancouver</li>
  <li>high cost of living</li>
  <li>dirt poor</li>
  <li>second son of the family</li>
  <li>my dad was a failed starving artist</li>
  <li>my mother worked at data entry at a bank</li>
  <li>she was fat with a broken back</li>
  <li>and at home they didn’t do much but eat and watch TV</li>
  <li>I mostly grew up alone on books and the computer</li>
  <li>at school I was never really bullied</li>
  <li>I’d come home and my parents would ask</li>
  <li>Were you bullied today at school?</li>
  <li>Nothing happened at school</li>
  <li>I just hid behind the back at lunch and did nothing</li>
  <li>all of my life just nothing</li>
  <li>I got a job below my skills and paid my way through college</li>
  <li>but the rage ate away at me</li>
  <li>I would walk along the streets for hours</li>
  <li>just walking away the rage</li>
  <li>I had violent and suicidal and sexual and jealous thoughts</li>
  <li>I began to suffer at college</li>
  <li>I sat in a haze at the library through exams for courses I hadn’t been to all semester</li>
  <li>but I pushed through</li>
  <li>I got an Associate’s Degree in <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr></li>
  <li>I worked part time 10 hours a week</li>
  <li>barely</li>
  <li>are a job that didn’t really use my skills</li>
  <li>at night I would feel like I was choking on the smell of burning garbage</li>
  <li>so I would go for long walks</li>
  <li>I started writing poetry</li>
  <li>just sitting at the library and writing poetry all day</li>
  <li>I developed weird pains through out my body</li>
  <li>I always had body issues</li>
  <li>and when I was 24 I got badly sunburned</li>
  <li>I freaked out and went to the emergency room</li>
  <li>fully convinced I was dying of skin cancer</li>
  <li>I kept going on in a fog</li>
  <li>in pain and suicidal everyday</li>
  <li>I was convinced my face was swelling up oddly</li>
  <li>it was round about a year after that</li>
  <li>I began meditating</li>
  <li>and it really saved my life</li>
  <li>I became really accomplished</li>
  <li>I meditated a lot</li>
  <li>I had to because I was in so much pain</li>
  <li>but soon the choking rage came back</li>
  <li>eventually I bought a skirt</li>
  <li>and it was when I put it on I had to admit I was trans</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s no conclusion here except maybe things didn’t have to be like
this and you don’t really know what handicaps people are struggling
with just by looking at their skin or apparent gender and I don’t
really believe in bad guys and punishment anymore. When you’ve been to
that point where you’re a danger to yourself and others you know it’s
already punishment enough.</p>

<p>Things are getting better. I’m working more. I hope I’ll be able to
get a job making real use of my coding skills eventually.</p>]]></content><author><name>mspondee</name></author><category term="Prose" /><category term="2020" /><category term="Auto" /><category term="She Coded" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally posted at dev.to.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Little Thing</title><link href="https://mstewartgallus.github.io/poem/2022/12/06/little-thing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Little Thing" /><published>2022-12-06T19:45:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-12-06T19:45:00-08:00</updated><id>https://mstewartgallus.github.io/poem/2022/12/06/little-thing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mstewartgallus.github.io/poem/2022/12/06/little-thing/"><![CDATA[<p class="stanza"><span role="presentation" class="line">A small thing sat in the dirt</span><br /><span role="presentation" class="line">legs splayed, hands by its sides.</span><br /><span role="presentation" class="line"><q>I am tall</q> it said</span><br /><span role="presentation" class="line">and stood to prove its point.</span></p>

Head on the ground legs in the air.</p>

<p>It is a cool dark evening and I am safe and sheltered in my warm
winter coat.  I am in the park near the highway.  I hear the traffic
rumble in the distance.  Nearby a crow pecks at a stick and hops
around cawwing.</p>

<p>Rotations done for the day I head home.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is sometime after bedtime and I am awake under warm heavy weighted
blankets.</p>

<p>A coppery taste comes up from my throat.  I ponder taking a vegetable
peeler to my flesh.  My legs bend back at the hips at a 90° angle.  I
am a worm.  I pull at my face nuzzling my cheeks against my hands my
soft squishy flesh comforting in sensory feeling.  Between my false
ribs throbs a dull ache.</p>

<hr />

<p>I wake up at 1:00 <abbr title="Ante Meridiem">AM</abbr> with my cock twitching and my nipples
aching.  I masturbate to fantasies of being tied up, forced femmed,
put in latex and groped and raped.</p>

<p>This morning I feel like the dried crust at the bottom of an unwashed
coffee cup.  I reach over to my phone on my the desk beside my bed to
look for some of my favorite porn.  It is 10:09 <abbr title="Ante Meridiem">AM</abbr> and I have a
dentist appointment soon.</p>

<p><q>Ah fuck!</q></p>

<p>I struggle out of my floral jam jams and into a pair of deep blue
jeans.  I pull on a long sleeved red shirt and pick up my morning meds
and rush out the bedroom to the door.  On the way hurrying to the bus
stop I phone the dentist.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the way to the coffee shop it seems as if those around me are
puppets moving all stiff and herky-jerky.  The yellow crane in a
nearby building under construction becomes a little toy.  Toy cars and
toy houses and toy people.</p>

<p>I take a shit in the coffee shop after talking to a cute girl.</p>]]></content><author><name>mspondee</name></author><category term="Prose" /><category term="Coffee" /><category term="Dating" /><category term="Dentist" /><category term="Rotations" /><category term="Transgender" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I rotate up to a 45° angle.

  <p>The art of the spoken word is not accessible to the visually impaired.
Most markup navigates awkwardly, does not insert appropriate pauses
for breath, and mispronounces stress and sounds.  Consider
<a href="#markupa"><cite>Markup A</cite></a> and <a href="#markupb"><cite>Markup
B</cite></a>.  In <a href="#markupa"><cite>Markup A</cite></a> a poem is
an ordered list of stanzas and stanzas are ordered lists of verses.
In <a href="#markupb"><cite>Markup B</cite></a> poems are sequences of stanzas,
stanzas are paragraphs and lines in a paragraph are separated by line
break elements.</p>

  <p>As a <i>nuclear</i> solution you can markup the text for graphical
display using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">graphic</code> role as in <a href="#markupn"><cite>Markup
N</cite></a>.  I advise use of the <s><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-labelledby</code></s> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-details</code>
(2022-11-28) attribute instead of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-label</code> attribute
here. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-label</code> has a tendency to work poorly with newlines in
text, is not usually translated by automated tools and doesn’t let you
embed more markup as appropriate.</p>

  <p>In some setups <a href="#markupb"><cite>Markup B</cite></a> sounds yucky.  Ending
and starting words in separate lines like <i>red</i> and
<i>Violets</i> run together.  You might include extra punctuation
annotated with a screen-reader-only class as with <a href="#markupb2"><cite>Markup
A’</cite></a> and <a href="#markupb3"><cite>Markup B’ <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></cite></a> to work around this issue.
However, on Firefox this hack breaks up lines into separate areas to
track through.</p>

  <p>No revisions of <a href="#markupa"><cite>Markup A</cite></a> or <a href="#markupb"><cite>Markup B</cite></a> ensure
proper pronunciation of stress and sounds.  Only American English is
likely to be pronounced correctly. To help, you can set the language
attribute for documents and poems as appropriate.  However, this is
not a complete solution.</p>

  <p>As an anglophone Canadian author I set the language attribute for my
documents and poems to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">en-CA</code>. However, this only helps with English
words and not with imports from other languages.  I don’t know how to
help screen readers pronounce names of mythical figures.  You could
markup individual phrases like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;i lang="non"&gt;Sleipnir&lt;/i&gt;</code> (old
Norse) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;i lang="gem"&gt;Wotan&lt;/i&gt;</code> (Germanic languages group) but
this particular markup doesn’t help.</p>

  <p>Semantically you might markup stress with emphasis with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code>
element.  However, such markup is verbose and many screen readers
ignore elements like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em</code> because of the heavy unsemantic abuse of
such elements in the wider internet for presenting bold text.</p>

  <p>Perhaps there might be some obscure Unicode diacritics for better
marking up the prosody but I have not explored this option.  I worry
that such glyphs might be pronounced in common screen readers as
something like <q>Unicode character 591</q>.</p>

  <p>Laying out poetry on small formats is awkward.  In print the standard
layout for overlong lines is to align the first line ragged right and
all other lines ragged left.</p>

  <p>You can approximate a poetry layout with a hanging indent layout
something like <a href="#indentcss"><cite>Indent <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></cite></a>.  However, a
hanging indent layout is not really correct.</p>

  <p>You can approximate a poetry layout on the web by aligning every line
block to the left but aligning the last line of the text <em>within</em> the
line block to the right.  Something like <a href="#alignlastcss"><cite>Align Last
<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></cite></a> almost works for a poetry layout.  However,
even this layout fails when you overflow multiple lines.</p>

  <p>Personally I found Android TalkBack to be the easiest screen reader to
get started with. <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com">The helpful
<cite>A11y Project</cite> blog</a> has a number of guides on getting
started with screen readers but they might be a little old.</p>

  <p>As of this blog post, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-speech-1/"><cite><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Speech
Module</cite></a> has never really
gone anywhere.  Perhaps in the future the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">voice-stress</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">voice-duration</code> (for long syllables), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">voice-pitch</code> (for pitch
accent) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pause</code> properties would solve these sort of accessibility
problems.</p>

<p>Today I was curled up in my little coconut shell closet nibbling on a

<p>A quick peek out of my hut and it seemed as if my owner had spilled
spaghetti across her lover’s prodigious chest but in the process of

my owner’s lover proceeded to mime playing a guitar while stroking my
