I am a woman and I have pale cream
colored fur. Being a hamster I am a solitary sort but I actually like
my owner. The only thing is I wish my owner and her lover wouldn’t
have such loud and annoying sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard a woman scream &lt;q&gt;scootaloo&lt;/q&gt; during an orgasm? Or
hear your owner poke her lover’s tits for ten minutes straight saying
beep, boop, beep boop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was curled up in my little coconut shell closet nibbling on a
lightly fermented pumpkin seed while my owner and her lover were
having dinner. They were having spaghetti with ground beef. I had a
craving for mealworms but all I had were seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Quick cover Silk’s eyes&lt;/q&gt; my owner yelled and I knew I was in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick peek out of my hut and it seemed as if my owner had spilled
spaghetti across her lover’s prodigious chest but in the process of
mopping things up had entangled themselves onto the floor. Whereupon
my owner’s lover proceeded to mime playing a guitar while stroking my
owner’s clit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum&lt;/q&gt; my owner sung to the tune of
&lt;q&gt;Little Drummer Boy&lt;/q&gt; while miming playing bongos with her lover’s
chest.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Molossus Spondee</name></author><category term="Prose" /><category term="Hamster" /><summary type="html">My name is Silk and I am a hamster.

However, the best
coffee per dollar is objective fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with chain fast food coffee is not poor quality but rather
inconsistency.  Despite guidelines otherwise I assume it is likely
many coffee machines are unwashed for days or many pots of coffee are
kept stale on warm for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So timing and location are key. Depending on the shift and the volume
of customers you may or may not obtain a fresh cup of coffee. Never
order decaf. I assume the employees must spit it in it or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of coffee is psychological and internal to the
self. Coffee can be tough on the stomach and should be consumed in
small quantities along with a small amount of some bread stuff. But
moreover, time of day and relative thirst or hunger plays a role as
well.  The best coffee is consumed early in the morning along with the
thick fog of a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting and weather are critical as well. The best coffee is drunk in
a warm comfortable quiet place and at the same time under an umbrella
during the rain in a park. Both are key ingredients. The best coffee
requires walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few locations in Vancouver near a nice park and near a
quiet place with good internet access like a public library. Some
pleasant locations to look around from include the central library and
the sea wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately such matters are also predicated on time. Nothing is
constant and especially not coffee. Coffee is more of a feel or matter
of experience for certain locations and times than for research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not share my favorite locations. Small grimy places, a few
chains, a few hipster places you can look up on any review blog of
coffee in Vancouver. I do not want you to spoil the atmosphere and I
hate you and wish you a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really must try circling out from some skate parks or
underneath highway overpasses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Molossus Spondee</name></author><category term="Prose" /><category term="Coffee" /><summary type="html">The best coffee in Vancouver is a matter of taste.

purifier and shitposted away on the internet.  My Saint Sebastian
ex-gay thread had sparked an 80 page debate on the political forum I
frequented and I had to see the madness through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides some idiot had got bent into a rant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;You have no power here&lt;/q&gt; I replied.  And then again &lt;q&gt;I’m already dead
anyway pretty much&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She replied &lt;q&gt;ok&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked back every hour or so but she seemed to have stopped
replying even to my colorful image suggesting she was transgender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I returned to the routine.  Afraid I might grind my fingers in the
coffee grinder I opened the drawer it was kept in and checked it was
safely unplugged and stored away.  I stared up at the popcorn ceiling
breathless and watched little technicolor squiggles swirl around until
I fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supernatural intruded slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first night when I was wanking away at 12 &lt;abbr&gt;AM&lt;/abbr&gt;
imagining my ass being penetrated I heard a loud buzzing sound like
wasps.  I put it down to nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steadily the phenomenon added up.  A loud hum at the midnight hours.
When I rested before bed a sound like bells.  When I looked out one
eye a hue of colors different from the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday during my morning commute to the library where I do
nothing in particular I was met with the sudden urge to fling myself
off a highway overpass into the traffic below.  It was as if some worm
wrapped around my brain had contracted and struck me with itching pain
and a feeling of doom.  I changed my commute to avoid overpasses and
bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She sent me a message during the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up with a heavy weight pinning me in place.  A roiling darkness
sat on my chest.  I tried to move or call for help but could not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The darkness said her name was Must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she had planned to kill me but upon seeing how pathetic I was
decided to spare me and had decided to make my life a living hell
instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She explained I was her thrall now and that hell was both a physical
place and a state of mind.  Identity was a matter of perspective.  If
she could walk to me she would be me and if I could walk to her I
would be her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the night I drifted in and out of sleep.  Each time I
woke up I felt Must on top of me watching.  Until the morning sun
appeared when I woke up and the presence was gone completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Must had bent the day against me.  I was exhausted unable to breathe
or rest.  Moreover, as if by some illusion stripped away the people
around me had transformed into puppeted corpses.  Every trivial
interaction became an ordeal and I could no longer draw strength or
comfort from those who I had considered friends.  I could not bear to
meet the hideous gazes of those around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the night I was compelled to roam by a manic energy.  I felt
hot ash drawn into my chest when I was trying to sleep and cool relief
when I walked the night.  It is oddly calming during the midnight
hours when there is no traffic or human face to fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first task Must demanded of me was to hide the vanity of my flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was good the pain would lessen although never go away entirely.
If I was bad the pain would increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the numerous punishments meted out to me was a sudden stabbing
pain in a mole on my scrotum.  By this sudden intrusion into my life I
was made to rush to the bathroom to check if my junk was ok or at
urgent times to fondle myself in public.  Fear of this public
humiliation alienated myself further and I no longer attended events
hosted by my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon remained covered up at all times in long baggy sweaters and
pants.  I went to great lengths to avoid my appearance and even took
baths in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few months there were no further demands.  Still the pain
continued and I fell even further into a state of fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the constant pains administered to me I had grown
desensitized in my crotch.  A curious numbness developed much like a
newly killed tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other punishments Must had started to insert steel needles into
my arms during the night.  Shaving my arms near raw seemed to blunt
the pain a little somehow.  So I folded shaving my body hair into my
daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cope with the pain and suicidal ideations I developed an intense
practise of meditation.  I found it easiest to get started with the
book Meditation in Plain English and meditating lying on the ground.
I soon bought a zafu, a meditation mat, a meditation bench, a mala
bead braclet and necklace and a small Buddha statue for a personal
altar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My usual practice consisted of a small amount of yoga such as standing
tree pose to wake myself up and then proceeded to basic box breathing
for a few minutes to calm myself down.  Once sufficiently energized
and rested I meditated on my solar plexus and in rhythm subvocalized a
dharani (I preferred Om Shanti Shanti Shanti.)  My preferred
meditation position being easy pose although sometimes I found using a
meditation bench less straining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these trappings were really necessary of course.  If you
remember summer break lying on bed doing nothing just watching the
blanket rise and fall with your breath then that is meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numinal is hard to explain in words.  Sometimes I felt as if I was
moving like I was falling through a storm or a vast pressure on top of
me as if I was buried beneath the earth or there was a flickering red,
black, yellow vast expanse behind my closed eyelids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought for a while I was free of Must.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Molossus Spondee</name></author><category term="Prose" /><category term="If She Breathes" /><summary type="html">Like a pug in an oxygen mask I lied down on the carpet by the air purifier and shitposted away on the internet.
