&lt;h2&gt;The Slow Rot&lt;/h2&gt;
The slow rot
lived or died, it&apos;s hard to tell
And fires lost away / down to hell
And as wind trow to take / hero&apos;s hearth
To slimy lair / past danger&apos;s berth

The shepherd, lay, in drunken stupor
As wind waste fire back away
So the nimble thief he plot to fire hold
To rob chilly&apos;s empty hall of filth and cold

Through rot and ruin barely seeing
In darkness scarce light flickers fleeing
So journeyed Bound in circles round
The hunter searched, following found

Winged death, stumbling, the cripple come!
The slow rot, silent, cold and numb
All gravid full of piss and shit
He bit, swallowed, spit

But thief rallied, brandished knife and struck
Yet the wound was
Not hot and bleeding / but rotting, eating
The orc only coughed and shook
And yet more the cunning man he ate and took

Hands deep pocketed inside his guts
The thief struck with cuts and cuts
And heart in hand took torch to scour
So doctor kills doctor kills doctor&apos;s power!

&lt;h2&gt;The Quest&lt;/h2&gt;
war lost, Two was exiled and turned to banditry
where he assailed souls from all sides

till one day dreaming Two&apos;s heart rose up
and sleeping in a cave he had a dream

lift up, take up, stand up, young son, lost one, lost son

go seek the ring - find the cup, rise up young son
you live today - your heart beats still - and still sings on

for none can harm but what you sing, the heart you give
for bliss or ill this is your life _

and you choose how your story ends - not the knife
for hell or heaven, judgement day or angel&apos;s song 

no prison gate nor plague nor pain shall bar
the mercy of the court - stands uncontested

Two find the cup and ring, the treasure that I sing
and keep on - and on and on, for me, for you

all men die, all churches crumble - all this shall fall
the weight and measure of so much dross - this all 

just heart and soul - song and word and breath redeem
the weighty load you carry, wealth or burning coal

all sorrow then - just dust of men, thunder
the beating of the heart and - the singing soul
