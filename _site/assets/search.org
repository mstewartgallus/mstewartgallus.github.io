[[./search.mjs::history.scrollRestoration]]

FIXME unsure about scroll restoration.

[[./search.mjs::function submitRequest(]]

work around an incorrect action string for .formAction here.

[[./search.mjs::targeting = true]]

This is a little ugly but replace can trigger popstate (at least in
Chrome) and lead to a stack overflow.

[[./search.mjs::#focus.focus()]]

Timeout then blur?
