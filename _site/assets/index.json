I am not skilled in accessibility and I don’t have good solutions. See Try It if you want to try out a screen reader yourself. Special thanks to the kind people who helped edit this post.    Accessibility  § The art of the spoken word is not accessible to the visually impaired. Most markup navigates awkwardly, does not insert appropriate pauses for breath, and mispronounces stress and sounds. Consider Markup A and Markup B. In Markup A a poem is an ordered list of stanzas and stanzas are ordered lists of verses. In Markup B poems are sequences of stanzas, stanzas are paragraphs and lines in a paragraph are separated by line break elements.  Markup A# &lt;ol class=\"poem\"&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Roses are red&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Violets are blue,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sugar is sweet&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;And so are you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;    Markup B# &lt;p class=\"stanza\"&gt;Roses are red&lt;br&gt; Violets are blue,&lt;br&gt; Sugar is sweet&lt;br&gt; And so are you.&lt;/p&gt;   Markup A is hard to navigate as each line in an ordered list must be manually tracked through. As well line m of n is repeated for every line of Markup A. You can use the presentation ARIA role as in Markup A and Markup A’’ to ameliorate the problem. By the spec using the presentation role in a list item for a list already marked with a presentation role doesn’t do much, but such markup can reduce cruft in Firefox’s accessibility inspector.  Markup A'# &lt;ol class=\"poem\"&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;ol role=\"presentation\"&gt; &lt;li role=\"presentation\"&gt;Roses are red&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li role=\"presentation\"&gt;Violets are blue,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li role=\"presentation\"&gt;Sugar is sweet&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li role=\"presentation\"&gt;And so are you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;    Markup A''# &lt;ol class=\"poem\" role=\"presentation\"&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;ol role=\"presentation\"&gt; &lt;li role=\"presentation\"&gt;Roses are red&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li role=\"presentation\"&gt;Violets are blue,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li role=\"presentation\"&gt;Sugar is sweet&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li role=\"presentation\"&gt;And so are you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;   As a nuclear solution you can markup the text for graphical display using the graphic role as in Markup N. I advise use of the aria-labelledby aria-details (2022-11-28) attribute instead of the aria-label attribute here. aria-label has a tendency to work poorly with newlines in text, is not usually translated by automated tools and doesn’t let you embed more markup as appropriate.  Markup N# &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div role=\"img\" aria-details=\"transcript\"&gt; &lt;ol class=\"poem\"&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Roses are red&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Violets are blue,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sugar is sweet&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;And so are you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption id=\"transcript\"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Transcript for text to speech:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Roses are red ; Violets are blue, Sugar is sweet ; And so are you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;   In some setups Markup B sounds yucky. Ending and starting words in separate lines like red and Violets run together. You might include extra punctuation annotated with a screen-reader-only class as with Markup A’ and Markup B’ CSS to work around this issue. However, on Firefox this hack breaks up lines into separate areas to track through.  Markup B' HTML # &lt;p&gt;Roses are red&lt;span class=\"sr-only\"&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Violets are blue,&lt;br&gt; Sugar is sweet&lt;span class=\"sr-only\"&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; And so are you.&lt;/p&gt;    Markup B' CSS # .sr-only { display: inline-block ; user-select: none ; font-size: 1px ; line-height: 1px ; color: transparent ; }   No revisions of Markup A or Markup B ensure proper pronunciation of stress and sounds. Only American English is likely to be pronounced correctly. To help, you can set the language attribute for documents and poems as appropriate. However, this is not a complete solution. As an anglophone Canadian author I set the language attribute for my documents and poems to en-CA. However, this only helps with English words and not with imports from other languages. I don’t know how to help screen readers pronounce names of mythical figures. You could markup individual phrases like &lt;i lang=\"non\"&gt;Sleipnir&lt;/i&gt; (old Norse) and &lt;i lang=\"gem\"&gt;Wotan&lt;/i&gt; (Germanic languages group) but this particular markup doesn’t help. Semantically you might markup stress with emphasis with the em element. However, such markup is verbose and many screen readers ignore elements like em because of the heavy unsemantic abuse of such elements in the wider internet for presenting bold text. Perhaps there might be some obscure Unicode diacritics for better marking up the prosody but I have not explored this option. I worry that such glyphs might be pronounced in common screen readers as something like Unicode character 591.     Presentation  § Laying out poetry on small formats is awkward. In print the standard layout for overlong lines is to align the first line ragged right and all other lines ragged left. You can approximate a poetry layout with a hanging indent layout something like Indent CSS. However, a hanging indent layout is not really correct.  Indent CSS # .line { text-indent: -4ch ; margin-left: 4ch ; }   You can approximate a poetry layout on the web by aligning every line block to the left but aligning the last line of the text within the line block to the right. Something like Align Last CSS almost works for a poetry layout. However, even this layout fails when you overflow multiple lines.  Align Last CSS # .stanza { display: flex ; flex-direction: column ; align-items: start ; } .line { display: block ; text-align-last: end ; }   Example and Example Code are similar to the current compromise I use on this site.  Example#    Roses are red Violets are blue Sugar is sweet aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.     Example Code# &lt;style&gt; #scope p { text-indent: 0 ; padding: 0 ; } #scope p &gt; span { display: inline-block ; text-align-last: end ; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div id=\"scope\" lang=\"en-CA\"&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Roses are red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span&gt;Violets are blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span&gt;Sugar is sweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span&gt;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;       Conclusion  § You should use the audio element to markup poetry.     Try It  § Personally I found Android TalkBack to be the easiest screen reader to get started with. The helpful A11y Project blog has a number of guides on getting started with screen readers but they might be a little old.  Getting Started with Orca screen reader on Gnome desktop environment on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Getting Started with VoiceOver on iOS Getting Started with NVDA Getting Started with MacOS VoiceOver      And One More Thing  § As of this blog post, the CSS Speech Module has never really gone anywhere. Perhaps in the future the voice-stress, voice-duration (for long syllables), voice-pitch (for pitch accent) and pause properties would solve these sort of accessibility problems.

However, the best coffee per dollar is objective fact. The problem with chain fast food coffee is not poor quality but rather inconsistency. Despite guidelines otherwise I assume it is likely many coffee machines are unwashed for days or many pots of coffee are kept stale on warm for hours. So timing and location are key. Depending on the shift and the volume of customers you may or may not obtain a fresh cup of coffee. Never order decaf. I assume the employees must spit it in it or something. The other side of coffee is psychological and internal to the self. Coffee can be tough on the stomach and should be consumed in small quantities along with a small amount of some bread stuff. But moreover, time of day and relative thirst or hunger plays a role as well. The best coffee is consumed early in the morning along with the thick fog of a headache. Setting and weather are critical as well. The best coffee is drunk in a warm comfortable quiet place and at the same time under an umbrella during the rain in a park. Both are key ingredients. The best coffee requires walking. There are a few locations in Vancouver near a nice park and near a quiet place with good internet access like a public library. Some pleasant locations to look around from include the central library and the sea wall. Unfortunately such matters are also predicated on time. Nothing is constant and especially not coffee. Coffee is more of a feel or matter of experience for certain locations and times than for research. I will not share my favorite locations. Small grimy places, a few chains, a few hipster places you can look up on any review blog of coffee in Vancouver. I do not want you to spoil the atmosphere and I hate you and wish you a bad day.

My Saint Sebastian ex-gay thread had sparked an 80 page debate on the political forum I frequented and I had to see the madness through. Besides some idiot had got bent into a rant. You have no power here I replied. And then again I’m already dead anyway pretty much She replied ok. I checked back every hour or so but she seemed to have stopped replying even to my colorful image suggesting she was transgender. So I returned to the routine. Afraid I might grind my fingers in the coffee grinder I opened the drawer it was kept in and checked it was safely unplugged and stored away. I stared up at the popcorn ceiling breathless and watched little technicolor squiggles swirl around until I fell asleep.  The supernatural intruded slowly. The first night when I was wanking away at 12 AM imagining my ass being penetrated I heard a loud buzzing sound like wasps. I put it down to nerves. Steadily the phenomenon added up. A loud hum at the midnight hours. When I rested before bed a sound like bells. When I looked out one eye a hue of colors different from the other. On Thursday during my morning commute to the library where I do nothing in particular I was met with the sudden urge to fling myself off a highway overpass into the traffic below. It was as if some worm wrapped around my brain had contracted and struck me with itching pain and a feeling of doom. I changed my commute to avoid overpasses and bridges.  She sent me a message during the night. I woke up with a heavy weight pinning me in place. A roiling darkness sat on my chest. I tried to move or call for help but could not. The darkness said her name was Must. She said she had planned to kill me but upon seeing how pathetic I was decided to spare me and had decided to make my life a living hell instead. She explained I was her thrall now and that hell was both a physical place and a state of mind. Identity was a matter of perspective. If she could walk to me she would be me and if I could walk to her I would be her. For the rest of the night I drifted in and out of sleep. Each time I woke up I felt Must on top of me watching. Until the morning sun appeared when I woke up and the presence was gone completely.  Must had bent the day against me. I was exhausted unable to breathe or rest. Moreover, as if by some illusion stripped away the people around me had transformed into puppeted corpses. Every trivial interaction became an ordeal and I could no longer draw strength or comfort from those who I had considered friends. I could not bear to meet the hideous gazes of those around me. During the night I was compelled to roam by a manic energy. I felt hot ash drawn into my chest when I was trying to sleep and cool relief when I walked the night. It is oddly calming during the midnight hours when there is no traffic or human face to fear.  The first task Must demanded of me was to hide the vanity of my flesh. If I was good the pain would lessen although never go away entirely. If I was bad the pain would increase. One of the numerous punishments meted out to me was a sudden stabbing pain in a mole on my scrotum. By this sudden intrusion into my life I was made to rush to the bathroom to check if my junk was ok or at urgent times to fondle myself in public. Fear of this public humiliation alienated myself further and I no longer attended events hosted by my friends. I soon remained covered up at all times in long baggy sweaters and pants. I went to great lengths to avoid my appearance and even took baths in the dark.  For a few months there were no further demands. Still the pain continued and I fell even further into a state of fog. As a result of the constant pains administered to me I had grown desensitized in my crotch. A curious numbness developed much like a newly killed tooth. Among other punishments Must had started to insert steel needles into my arms during the night. Shaving my arms near raw seemed to blunt the pain a little somehow. So I folded shaving my body hair into my daily routine.  To cope with the pain and suicidal ideations I developed an intense practise of meditation. I found it easiest to get started with the book Meditation in Plain English and meditating lying on the ground. I soon bought a zafu, a meditation mat, a meditation bench, a mala bead braclet and necklace and a small Buddha statue for a personal altar. My usual practice consisted of a small amount of yoga such as standing tree pose to wake myself up and then proceeded to basic box breathing for a few minutes to calm myself down. Once sufficiently energized and rested I meditated on my solar plexus and in rhythm subvocalized a dharani (I preferred Om Shanti Shanti Shanti.) My preferred meditation position being easy pose although sometimes I found using a meditation bench less straining. None of these trappings were really necessary of course. If you remember summer break lying on bed doing nothing just watching the blanket rise and fall with your breath then that is meditation. The numinal is hard to explain in words. Sometimes I felt as if I was moving like I was falling through a storm or a vast pressure on top of me as if I was buried beneath the earth or there was a flickering red, black, yellow vast expanse behind my closed eyelids. I thought for a while I was free of Must.","n":0.031},"2":[{"v":"If She Breathes","i":0,"n":0.577}],"3":[{"v":"Prose","i":0,"n":1}]}},{"i":14,"$":{"0":{"v":"Purple Sands","n":0.707},"1":{"v":" in a land of purple sands&thinsp;—&thinsp;a glasswork city grewcathedrals of stained glass&thinsp;—&thinsp;and a likewise people too  from the land the Glassmen sprung&thinsp;—&thinsp;as flowers from the earthlinked as one&thinsp;—&thinsp;one people all from birth  such was this race of men&thinsp;—&thinsp;that none could hate or condemnand no one could suffer ill&thinsp;—&thinsp;for death would the killer kill  and of this strangest race&thinsp;—&thinsp;they had no need for face or tonguefor each and all saw alike&thinsp;—&thinsp;as through glass&thinsp;—&thinsp;the one  to the city she brought&thinsp;—&thinsp;strange coins, strange eyesstrange clothing, tantalizing hips and thighs  a stranger wandered in&thinsp;—&thinsp;she had a voice you could not knowa heart they could not recall&thinsp;—&thinsp;and so much blood","n":0.098},"2":[{"v":"2022","i":1,"n":1},{"v":"2019","i":0,"n":1}],"3":[{"v":"Poem","i":0,"n":1}]}},{"i":15,"$":{"0":{"v":"Mammon","n":1},"1":{"v":" Two found the castle&thinsp;—&thinsp;and petitioned the dragon athis court&thinsp;—&thinsp;where the beast crouched atop his horde of gold   Lord Mammon&thinsp;—&thinsp;by right of property and on appeal to your convictions?Might you gift the ring I should inherit?

Amongst the usual forums I found a black mass with a leaking stoma. Wendigo. I walked in chewing on one last cigarette butt. Hey it’s a genuine exploit! I explained. They never intended you to use cigarettes like this so it leaks metadata like crazy. I took another drink of coffee. It didn’t wash the taste out of my mouth but it helped to pretend it did.

The moles were climbing along his arm. One mole in particular was cracked and infected. Ollie plugged the bathtub and turned off the lights. Ollie slowly pulled himself into the bathtub and once seated turned on the tap. Ollie twitched as fear gripped his heart like a tapeworm.  I wake up late in the afternoon with a splitting headache. TMJ, bad posture and too much time on the internet. I swallow a Tylenol and pull myself out of bed. By sunset I make it to the door. I throw on a large coat to hide my meagre gyno and head out.  Ollie began the day’s ceremony of grinding coffee. Ollie unplugged the coffee grinder. Ollie poured in the coffee beans. Ollie plugged in the coffee grinder. Ollie thought about putting his fingers in the coffee grinder. Ollie ground the coffee. Ollie unplugged the coffee grinder. Ollie spotted left out scissors on the countertop. Ollie thought about sticking the scissors in his eyes. Ollie put the scissors away in the drawer beneath the countertop.  Downtown, I sip a cup of coffee comatose in a chain coffee shop until near midnight. It’s very quiet and there’s no traffic on the street. You can walk across the road pretty freely and there’s a pleasant feeling like soft cotton in your head. In the dark in the bad parts of town out among the street people I start to feel a little alive.  Ollie took a cup of coffee and a slice of banana bread to the little table in the hall outside the college library proper. Ollie crumpled over his laptop and began to exorcise the images that dug like wasps against his skull. Earlier that day a man and a woman kissed in the park. I thought: I should tackle the girl to the ground and I should smash her head against the pavement and I should rape her.  I take a shit in a public bathroom in Victory square. A massive constipation coffee dump. The guy in the room watching everything reminds me to flush. Fucker. I walk home down through China town. I’m tall and keep away from those roaming about at these hours. A deep anger keeps me moving on through the cool air.  Ollie rushed out of the classroom claiming he needed to go to the toilet. Ollie’s balls hurt. Ollie’s balls hurt a lot. In the toilet stall Ollie fiddled with his nuts. Balls in a rubber sack the cords caught twisted burning.  I make it home my legs all tired and the spite worked out a little. I turn off the lights and lie down prone in bed under the covers and I masturbate with my fist pressuring myself thinking of women and cock. I touch my chest and I think of shiny goddesses.  Ollie orgasmed face down grinding his hips against his bed and hand and staining the sheets with clear fluid and a foul smell.","n":0.044},"2":[],"3":[{"v":"Prose","i":0,"n":1}]}},{"i":23,"$":{"0":{"v":"The Rock","n":0.707},"1":{"v":" What clay figure sickly rotten, stands before usunformed, smashed&thinsp;—&thinsp;mockery of God's begotten?Do you think?

My head a pounding agony lying trapped beneath the embrace of my oneitis and enfolded in the choking intoxication of a vape fiend’s addiction in a closet sized apartment.
