Like a pug in an oxygen mask I lied down on the carpet by the air
purifier and shitposted away on the internet. My Saint Sebastian
ex-gay thread had sparked on 80 page debate on the political forum I
frequented and I had to see the madness through.

Besides some social justice warrior had got bent into a rant.

"You have no power here" I replied And then again "I'm already dead
anyway pretty much"

She replied "ok".

I checked back every hour or so but she seemed to have stopped
replying even to my colorful image suggesting she was transgender.

So I returned to the routine.

Afraid I might grind my fingers in the coffee grinder I opened the
drawer it was kept in and checked it was safely unplugged and stored
away.

I stared up at the popcorn ceiling breathless and watched little
technicolor squiggles swirl around until I fell asleep.

***

It began slowly

The first night when I was wanking away at 12 PM imagining my ass
being penetrated I heard a loud buzzing sound like wasps. I put it
down to nerves.

Steadily the phenomenon added up. A loud hum at the midnight
hours. When I meditated before bed a sound like bells. When I look out
one eye a hue of colors different from the other.

On Thursday, during my morning commute to the library where I did
nothing in particular I was met with the sudden urge to fling myself
off a highway overpass into the traffic below. It was as if some worm
wrapped around my brain had contracted and struck me with itching pain
and a feeling of doom. I changed my commute to avoid overpasses and
bridges.

***

She sent me a message during the night.

Her name was Must.

She said she had planned to kill me but upon seeing how pathetic I was
decided to spare me and make my life a living hell instead.

She explained I was her thrall now and that hell was both a physical
place and a state of mind. Identity was a matter of perspective. If
she could walk to me she would be me and if I could walk to her I
would be her.

***

During the day I was exhausted unable to breathe or rest. Some outside
force had bent the day against me. As if somehow by some illusion
stripped away the people around me had transformed into puppeted
corpses.

During the night I was compelled to roam by a manic energy. I felt
steel needles driven into my chest when I was trying to sleep and cool
relief when I walked the night. It is oddly calming during the
midnight hours when there is no traffic or human face to fear.

***

The first task Must demanded of me was to hide the vanity of my flesh.

If I was good the pain would lessen although never go away
entirely. If I was bad the pain would increase.

One of the numerous punishments Must meted out to me was a sudden
stabbing pain in a mole on my scrotum.

By this sudden intrusion into my life I was made to rush to the
bathroom to check if my junk was alright or at urgent times to fondle
myself in public. Fear of this public humiliation alienated myself
further and I no longer attended events hosted by my friends.

I soon remained covered up at all times in long baggy sweaters and
pants. I went to great lengths to avoid my appearance and even took
baths in the dark.

***

For a few months there were no further demands. Still the pain
continued and I fell even further into a state of fog.

As a result of the constant pains administered by Must I had grown
desensitized in the nether regions. A curious numbness had developed
down there much like a newly killed tooth.

Among other punishments Must had started to insert needles into my
arms during the night. Shaving my arms near raw seemed to blunt the
pain a little somehow.  So I folded shaving my body hair into my daily
routine.

***

The second demand of Must was a change in the consumption of my
internet content.  Despite the insinuations by some otherwise I had
never been particularly interested in men.  To my eyes the average
male porn star had always seemed rather orcish, fat and ugly in
appearance.  So I was not discomfited at all in Must's demand I browse
lesbian pornography.  However, I objected to the other sort of content
Must made me peruse.

Must's preferred punishment over this period of time became a sort of
intrusive thought: a psychic repetition of Must's demands throughout
the day at the worst moments and times. The more I tried to ignore
Must's assertions the more demands and unbiddened images came to mind.

So I developed a regular cycle of habits. I masturbated to the most
deplorable type of content late at night over the weekend and over the
work week suffered through a barrage of laviscious images and phrases.

I do not need to spell the content out to you do I?

***

To cope with the pain and suicidal ideations I developed an intense
practise of meditation.

I found it easiest to get started with the book Meditation in Plain
English and meditating lying down on the ground. 

I soon bought a zafu, a meditation mat, a meditation bench, a mala
bead braclet and necklace and a small Buddha statue for a personal
altar.

My usual practice consisted of a small amount of yoga such a standing
position to wake myself up and then proceeded to basic box breathing
for a few minutes to calm myself down. Once sufficiently both
energized and rested I meditated on my solar practice while in rhythm
subvocalizing a dharani (I preferred Om Shanti Shanti Shanti.) My
preferred meditation position being easy pose although sometimes I
found using a meditation bench easier.

None of this is really necessary of course. If you remember summer
break lying on bed doing nothing just watching the blanket rise and
fall with your breath then that is meditation.

The numinal is hard to explain in words.  Sometimes I felt as if I was
moving like I was falling through a storm or a vast pressure on top of
me as if I was buried beneath the earth.  Or there was a flickering
red, black, yellow vast expanse behind my closed eyelids.

Anyhow I thought for a while I was free of Must.

***

In contrary to my intent Must was delighted I engaged in meditation
and even complimented my Mala bead bracelet and necklace.  Must said
"They make for a pretty bitch."

...


***

Must's control over my internet usage further tightened and she urged
me to no longer see political online forums like I used to browse.  In
her words "I was her bitch alone."  The punishment for disobeying here
being I fell into a spiral of self-loathing and negativity. Weeks
where I browsed my usual content sparked in me a curious rage.  I fell
further into isolation from my friend group as I lashed out at them
with sarcastic jibes.

I think it may have been a few months later Must started ordering me
to buy clothing.

***

Though I was an entirely typical man I had no particular aversion to
crossdressing. As a matter of fact I had no real interest in clothing
at all and saw the matter mostly as shelter from the cold.  However, I
did find the prospect of buying clothing to set me off in nervous
agitation and trepidation.

More than once I recall I made it to a clothing store and then having
spent the last hour in transit to the location I suddenly turned
around and walked back home.

As she had explained identity was a matter of perspective. I had
walked to where she was and she had walked to where I was. So I was
her and she was me now. And so we departed ways.
