Ceaseless pacing - close behind
Gears colliding clash and - grind
In the - factory they dance and screach
Haephestus hand - mother, machine and man

Words become javelins of - war
Hermes-Thoth no - angel anymore
The - industrial disease of men
- Behold the rape of ink and pen

Words at war with - mind become the demon tyrant of mankind
