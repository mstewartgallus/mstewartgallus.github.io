#### Ten Things Demo

- [Ten Things app website](https://mstewartgallus.github.io/ten-things)
- [Ten Things app repository](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/ten-things)

Technology:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- <Abbr>CSS</Abbr>
- <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>

In <Time>2025</Time>, I decided to work on some demo apps for my
portfolio. Right now, I am finishing up a minimalist todo list
webapp. I had a lot of fun but I did run into a few unexpected issues
along the way.

The biggest problem was the unexpected difficulty of creating a custom
textbox which allowed content to flow into the editable text of the
textbox.  Unfortunately, I ended up going down a dead-end path
attempting to create a form-associated custom element. The impedance
mismatch of web components with React was too great to make the
form-associated custom element approach the ideal solution.
Eventually, I abandoned the custom form-associated custom element
approach and switched to using plain-old ARIA instead.

The other major issue involved in the project was figuring out the
precise details of a usable and accessible reorderable drag-and-drop
list. Figuring out a design that works adequately with keyboard, mouse
and phonescreen took a lot of reworking.

I also had minor difficulties with figuring out Redux and exactly how
to divide the application logic up between Redux and the broader
user-interface code. I think that I need to invest a bit more time
into learning about Redux.

I also had some minor probmes figuring out the broader design of the
webapp. I think in the future, I would put more effort into sketching
out the design on paper first.

#### Sticker/Flier Generator Demo

- [Sticker/Flier generator website](https://mstewartgallus.github.io/qrcode)
- [Sticker/Flier generator repository](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/qrcode)


Technology:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- <Abbr>SVG</Abbr>
- <Abbr>CSS</Abbr>
- <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>

The second big demo I finished was a sticker/flier generator.  At
Spartacus Books (a bookstore I volunteer at), I had
access to a thermal sticker printer (QL-800 Brother label printer)
that I spent some of my time making custom designs for, and I wanted
an easier process for the matter.

Unexpectedly, my biggest problem with the sticker generator was
implementing manual text-wrapping. Unlike <Abbr>HTML</Abbr> or similar
formats, <Abbr>SVG</Abbr>s do not wrap text for you.

<Comment>The second biggest problem along the way included choosing between
outputting <Abbr>PDF</Abbr>s or <Abbr>SVG</Abbr>s.</Comment>

The biggest unexpected difficulty I had here was manually implementing
the input event handler.

#### Other WebApps

Technology:

- [React](https://react.dev)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- <Abbr>CSS</Abbr>
- <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>
- <Abbr>SVG</Abbr>

I haven't polished the other web app demos up as much [Ten
Things](#ten things). Another webapp is a simple text-editor,
[Editor](https://mstewartgallus.github.io/editor).  The biggest
difficulty here was figuring out how to make a custom input field
using the `contenteditable` attribute and learning the `InputEvent`
API in much more detail.

#### Gatsby Blog

[Gatsby
blog](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/mstewartgallus.github.io)

Technology:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [<Abbr>MDX</Abbr>](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- JavaScript
- <Abbr>CSS</Abbr>
- <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>

In <Time>2023</Time>, I ported my poetry blog to
[Gatsby](gatsbyjs.com).  Mostly the project was smooth, but I found
the biggest problems to be Gatsby's lack of documentation.  I can
implement missing features I know about.  I cannot work around bugs
that have not been documented.

I am not a fan of GraphQL per se, but I can see the advantages of a
unified abstraction over different data sources.

Also the tutorial documentation for Gatsby gives oversimplified and
fragile designs for cases like blogging.  The suggested designs don't
work for cases like multiple source formats.  Just as a Markdown
plugin might process file nodes into Markdown nodes you want to
implement your own code processing Markdown nodes into a custom type
of nodes.  This isn't really a flaw with Gatsby that the tutorials
give the simplest but most fragile examples.

I suspect that I need something like a headless <Abbr>CMS</Abbr>.  I
need more structure than a pile of Markdown and <Abbr>YAML</Abbr>
files.

I am also interested in porting my blog to
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

### Jekyll Blog

[Jekyll blog](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/mstewartgallus.github.io/tree/ec7ef6af9b3aad70b0f389753109c8e27fefa465)

Technology:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)
- [<Abbr>SASS</Abbr>](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data)
- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app)
- JavaScript
- <Abbr>CSS</Abbr>
- <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>

In <Time>2022</Time>, I mostly worked on my poetry blog, and relearned
modern web development.  I found using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
to be copacetic.  My biggest struggle was figuring out how to
implement a search page which I solved by integrating
[Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) into my blog.

I had a lot of fun learning about fluid web typography and other
advanced techniques.

## Technology

#### React

I have found [React](https://react.dev) components to be less
problematic than I initially expected.  I expected lots of weird
problems due to the abstraction over top the native architecture of
the web.  I haven't really found such problems to be the case so far
although my website is relatively simple.

I think I need more structure to my project.  React is great for
making reusable components but not really a full framework.

React Pros

- Good for simple reusable components

React Cons

- Not suitable for state management (use something like Reduc)
- Not a full framework

#### <Abbr>MDX</Abbr>

[<Abbr>MDX</Abbr>](https://mdxjs.com/), a Markdown derivative which
lets you insert React components into Markdown, is interesting but has
some major caveats that make it a little awkward sometimess.

<Abbr>MDX</Abbr> Pros

- Good for ad-hoc page content with more control required. 

<Abbr>MDX</Abbr> Cons

- Bad for extremely structured content like blog posts
- Requires compiling


### GraalVM

[Code](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/peacod)

I also played a [little bit](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/peacod)
with [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) but I found it too
complicated for initial experimentation.  Also GraalVM had troubles
with tail recursion at the time which made it hard to implement
functional languages.  [Cadenza](https://github.com/ekmett/cadenza)
for example went through hoops I didn't want to bother with to
optimize tail calls.

### Java Virtual Machine

[Code](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/heaps)

Technology:

- [Java Virtual Machine Instruction Set](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html)
- [invokedynamic](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/understanding-java-method-invocation-with-invokedynamic)
 
I got heavily into low-level details of the Java Virtual Machine for a
while.  I learned to [use](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/heaps)
[ByteBuddy](https://bytebuddy.net/) and
[invokedynamic](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/understanding-java-method-invocation-with-invokedynamic)
to insert dynamically optimizable spots into a Java program.

### Lock-Free Programming

[Code](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/stacklock)

Technology:

- [<Abbr>MCS</Abbr> Locks](https://lwn.net/Articles/590243/)
- [<Abbr>TLA+</Abbr>](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/high-level-view.html)

I got heavily into lock-free programming for a while and
[played](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/stacklock) with making a
more efficient unfair lock implementation based on <Abbr>MCS</Abbr>
Locks that uses a stack instead of a queue. I also tried formalizing a
little bit of it in
[<Abbr>TLA+</Abbr>](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/high-level-view.html).

### Programming Language Theory

[Code](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/playground/blob/master/coexp.rkt)

Technology:

- [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)
- [<Abbr>PLT</Abbr> Redex](https://redex.racket-lang.org/)
- [Makam](http://astampoulis.github.io/makam/) 
- [Lambda Prolog](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~dale/lProlog/)

I've also been playing with technologies like [<Abbr>PLT</Abbr>
Redex](https://redex.racket-lang.org/) and
[Makam](http://astampoulis.github.io/makam/) (a dialect of [Lambda
Prolog](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~dale/lProlog/)) for rapid
prototyping of programming language interpreters.

You can see a tiny demo language in <Abbr>PLT</Abbr> Redex
[here](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/playground/blob/master/coexp.rkt)

A little language in Makam
[here](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/coc-makam) . Makam works
great for simply typed languages but full dependent types are **way
too** complicated in any implementation.

I got interested in compilers and interpreters for a while. I played a
bit with effect systems like Call-By-Push-Value (basically
<Abbr>ANF</Abbr>) and simple functional optimizations:
https://github.com/mstewartgallus/hs-callbypushvalue
https://github.com/mstewartgallus/compiler-2

### Category Theory

[Category theory experiments](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/category-fun)

Technology:

- [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)
- [Category theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory#section_Idea)

Basically I have found category theory stuff to be highly useful for
compiler and type theory stuff, less so for everything else.

In the past I was working on [formalizing a small amount of category
theory](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/category-fun) in
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

I'm playing around with type systems and formal methods right now and
I'm hopeful category theory can help with this.  I've been trying to
figure out how to make internal languages for many types of
categories. [I've
started](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/doublecatrel) on some ideas
to work within double categories like Rel.

I have a hunch you can generalize graded monads and adjoint functors
for a sort of graded [Call By Push
Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call-by-push-value) which ought
to be useful for a compiler <Abbr>IR</Abbr> to simplify optimization.

I got heavily into [category
theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory#section_Idea)
for a while. I am no longer convinced it is so simple to compile
computer programs to a categorical intermediate representation.  But a
start of an effort towards this might be [this
project](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/prologish) which compiles a
continuations based language to co-closed categories in a manner dual
to compiling the <Abbr>STLC</Abbr> to closed categories.  Basically
it's dual to the paper [Compiling to
categories](http://conal.net/papers/compiling-to-categories/) by Conal
Elliott.  I also found tagless final style is very clean for
parametric higher order abstract syntax.

I have found category theory very interesting although it does have
some weaknesses with respect to variable binding and higher category
theory.  Category theory tends towards a very combinatorial sort of
style which makes some things very verbose that would be much clearer
with name binders.  Unfortunately parametric foundations allowing
manipulation of name binders are kind of complicated.  The other big
hurdle with category theory is higher categories: categories of
categories.  Very quickly higher category theory gets messy to play
around with in an actual theorem prover.  I'm not sure if these
problems are fundamental or someone smarter than me can come up with
solutions.

### Coq

Coq Pros:

- Extremely powerful proof automation capabilities
- A plugin for everything

Coq Cons:

- Highly tied to specific foundations

### Ada <Abbr>SPARK</Abbr>

[Code](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/linted/tree/master)

In the past I got into hard real-time and safety critical stuff for a
while. I
[experimented](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/linted/tree/master)
with breaking a program into separate processes some of which are
verifiable in a safe dialect of [Ada
<Abbr>SPARK</Abbr>](https://www.adacore.com/about-spark).
