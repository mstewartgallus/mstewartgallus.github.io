# Words to Kick Your Teeth Out

A small blog where I post my personal poetry.

## Technical

My blog mostly used to be based around Jekyll but I found a number of
limitations.  Also I didn't really like Ruby as the backend language.

So I moved to GatsbyJS. The main problem with GatsbyJS is not enough
documentation.  I struggled a little with Gatsby's node model.  Some
idioms common with relational databases are a little awkward here.

Styling poetry properly but accessibly on the web was probably my
cleanest technical result.
