I was flush with good boy points from a recent contract with mama so I
decided to treat myself. Mama said if I do well with a practice gf I
could even get a real girl sometime!

Chrome display cryocases of black hoodied models lined the room.

At the depot running the counter was a lateshit twinkhon sales model
in a black suit. I estimated about two more years of viable use. One
more year if used roughly.

"We have a wide variety of models available dear"

"I don't care. I want a youngshit BDD passoid boymoder!"

"Quite the popular option lately but have you considered other models?
The lateshit gigahon roastie has quite a dedicated following."

"I want a smol pp girl boymoder not a toastie roastie!"

"Not every BDD passoid is a youngshit you know? We have quite a few
luckshit twinkhon futchboys waiting for a good home. How many good boy
points do you even have dear? You're looking for quite the expensive
option you know?"

I leaned my big boned man padding over the counter.

"I WANT A BDD BOYMODER PASSOID SMALL PP GIRL" I said through gritted
teeth.

Omae was getting unwise.

I pulled out a bag of McDonald's takeout from my voluminous
trenchcoat. All around the room models in their cryocases turned their
heads to look.

"Oh honey, you're a big boy! You wouldn't dare cause an incident would
you?"

"You try me and these chicken nuggies show just how much of a big boy
I am"
