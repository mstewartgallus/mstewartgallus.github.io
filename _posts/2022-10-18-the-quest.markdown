This is an excerpt from an epic poem I was working on years ago.
You can probably find it elsewhere online.

{% highlight poetry %}
war lost, Two was exiled and turned to banditry
where he assailed souls from all sides

till one day dreaming Two's heart rose up
and sleeping in a cave he had a dream

lift up, take up, stand up, young son, lost one, lost son

go seek the ring - find the cup, rise up young son
you live today - your heart beats still - and still sings on

for none can harm but what you sing, the heart you give
for bliss or ill this is your life _

and you choose how your story ends - not the knife
for hell or heaven, judgement day or angel's song 

no prison gate nor plague nor pain shall bar
the mercy of the court - stands uncontested

Two find the cup and ring, the treasure that I sing
and keep on - and on and on, for me, for you

all men die, all churches crumble - all this shall fall
the weight and measure of so much dross - this all 

just heart and soul - song and word and breath redeem
the weighty load you carry, wealth or burning coal

all sorrow then - just dust of men, thunder
the beating of the heart and - the singing soul
