title: About the Blog

This is a small blog where I post my personal poetry.

## Technical

My blog mostly used to be based around [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
but I found a number of limitations.  Also I didn't really like Ruby
as the backend language.

So I moved to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). The main problem
with GatsbyJS is not enough documentation.  I struggled a little with
Gatsby's node model.  Some idioms common with relational databases are
a little awkward here.

[Styling poetry properly but accessibly on the
web](https://mstewartgallus.github.io/web/2022/11/25/marking-up-poetry/)
was probably my cleanest technical result.
