#### Gatsby blog

[Gatsby blog](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/mstewartgallus.github.io)

Technology:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [<Abbr>MDX</Abbr>](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- JavaScript
- <Abbr>CSS</Abbr>
- <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>

In <Time>2023</Time> I ported my poetry blog to
[Gatsby](gatsbyjs.com).  Mostly the project was smooth but I found the
biggest problems to be Gatsby's lack of documentation.  I can
implement missing features I know about.  I can't work around bugs
that have not been documented.

I'm not a fan of GraphQL per se but I can see the advantages of a
unified abstraction over different data sources.  Personally I would
go for an abstraction along the lines of Datalog.

Also the tutorial documentation for Gatsby gives oversimplified and
fragile designs for cases like blogging.  The suggested designs don't
work for cases like multiple source formats.  Just as a Markdown
plugin might process file nodes into Markdown nodes you want to
implement your own code processing Markdown nodes into a custom type
of nodes.  This isn't really a flaw with Gatsby that the tutorials
give the simplest but most fragile examples.

I suspect I ultimately want something like a headless <Abbr>CMS</Abbr>
but very reduced in scale.  A pile of Markdown and <Abbr>YAML</Abbr>
files just isn't doing it anymore and I need a bit more structure.

Also I am interested in possibly porting my blog to
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).


#### React

I have found [React](https://react.dev) components to be less
problematic than I initially expected.  I expected lots of weird
problems due to the abstraction over top the native architecture of
the web.  I haven't really found such problems to be the case so far
although my website is relatively simple.

I think I need more structure to my project.  React is great for
making reusable components but not really a full framework.

React Pros

- Good for simple reusable components

React Cons

- Not suitable for state management (use something like Reduc)
- Not a full framework

#### <Abbr>MDX</Abbr>

[<Abbr>MDX</Abbr>](https://mdxjs.com/), a Markdown derivative which
lets you insert React components into Markdown, is interesting but has
some major caveats that make it a little awkward sometimess.

<Abbr>MDX</Abbr> Pros

- Good for ad-hoc page content with more control required. 

<Abbr>MDX</Abbr> Cons

- Bad for extremely structured content like blog posts
- Requires compiling

#### Accessibility

I'm a bit of a perfectionist so my special interest for 2022 has been
accessibility.  Learning how to use a screenreader has been eye
opening.  I found it easiest to get started with [Android
TalkBack](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/getting-started-talkback/).
Accessibility is very fiddly but makes for satisfying design problems
to tetris in the most amount of information with the least amount of
noise.

Most of my blog problems were fairly typical except for figuring out
how to markup poetry appropriately.  A fair bit of hacks were required
to obtain the appropriate sort of hanging indent presentation and to
obtain the appropriate pauses between sentences.  If you're not
careful with the markup the lines of the poem can run together or
worse the words can.  In the other direction, marking up a poem as an
ordered list might lead to a lot of noise.  Hearing "line m of n"
every single line of a poem might be a little messy.

### Jekyll blog

[Jekyll blog](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/mstewartgallus.github.io/tree/ec7ef6af9b3aad70b0f389753109c8e27fefa465)

Technology:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)
- [<Abbr>SASS</Abbr>](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data)
- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app)
- JavaScript
- <Abbr>CSS</Abbr>
- <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>

In <Time>2022</Time> I mostly worked on [my bizarro poetry
blog](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/mstewartgallus.github.io) and
relearned modern web development.  I have found using
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to be very copacetic.  The biggest
hiccup was figuring out how to implement a search page which I solved
by integrating [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) into my blog.

It has been really fun learning about fluid web typography and other
advanced techniques.  Fonts are definitely a headache online though.

### Category theory

[Category theory experiments](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/category-fun)

Technology:

- [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)
- [Category theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory#section_Idea)

Basically I have found category theory stuff to be highly useful for
compiler and type theory stuff, less so for everything else.

In the past I was working on [formalizing a small amount of category
theory](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/category-fun) in
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

I'm playing around with type systems and formal methods right now and
I'm hopeful category theory can help with this.  I've been trying to
figure out how to make internal languages for many types of
categories. [I've
started](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/doublecatrel) on some ideas
to work within double categories like Rel.

I have a hunch you can generalize graded monads and adjoint functors
for a sort of graded [Call By Push
Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call-by-push-value) which ought
to be useful for a compiler <Abbr>IR</Abbr> to simplify optimization.

I got heavily into [category
theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory#section_Idea)
for a while. I am no longer convinced it is so simple to compile
computer programs to a categorical intermediate representation.  But a
start of an effort towards this might be [this
project](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/prologish) which compiles a
continuations based language to co-closed categories in a manner dual
to compiling the <Abbr>STLC</Abbr> to closed categories.  Basically
it's dual to the paper [Compiling to
categories](http://conal.net/papers/compiling-to-categories/) by Conal
Elliott.  I also found tagless final style is very clean for
parametric higher order abstract syntax.

I have found category theory very interesting although it does have
some weaknesses with respect to variable binding and higher category
theory.  Category theory tends towards a very combinatorial sort of
style which makes some things very verbose that would be much clearer
with name binders.  Unfortunately parametric foundations allowing
manipulation of name binders are kind of complicated.  The other big
hurdle with category theory is higher categories: categories of
categories.  Very quickly higher category theory gets messy to play
around with in an actual theorem prover.  I'm not sure if these
problems are fundamental or someone smarter than me can come up with
solutions.

### Programming language theory

[Code](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/playground/blob/master/coexp.rkt)

Technology:

- [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)
- [<Abbr>PLT</Abbr> Redex](https://redex.racket-lang.org/)
- [Makam](http://astampoulis.github.io/makam/) 
- [Lambda Prolog](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~dale/lProlog/)

I've also been playing with technologies like [<Abbr>PLT</Abbr>
Redex](https://redex.racket-lang.org/) and
[Makam](http://astampoulis.github.io/makam/) (a dialect of [Lambda
Prolog](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~dale/lProlog/)) for rapid
prototyping of programming language interpreters.

You can see a tiny demo language in <Abbr>PLT</Abbr> Redex
[here](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/playground/blob/master/coexp.rkt)

A little language in Makam
[here](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/coc-makam) . Makam works
great for simply typed languages but full dependent types are **way
too** complicated in any implementation.

I got interested in compilers and interpreters for a while. I played a
bit with effect systems like Call-By-Push-Value (basically
<Abbr>ANF</Abbr>) and simple functional optimizations:
https://github.com/mstewartgallus/hs-callbypushvalue
https://github.com/mstewartgallus/compiler-2


### Coq

Coq Pros:

- Extremely powerful proof automation capabilities
- A plugin for everything

Coq Cons:

- Highly tied to specific foundations

### GraalVM

[Code](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/peacod)

I also played a [little bit](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/peacod)
with [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) but I found it too
complicated for initial experimentation.  Also GraalVM had troubles
with tail recursion at the time which made it hard to implement
functional languages.  [Cadenza](https://github.com/ekmett/cadenza)
for example went through hoops I didn't want to bother with to
optimize tail calls.

### Java virtual machine

[Code](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/heaps)

Technology:

- [Java Virtual Machine Instruction Set](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html)
- [invokedynamic](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/understanding-java-method-invocation-with-invokedynamic)
 
I got heavily into low-level details of the Java Virtual Machine for a
while.  I learned to [use](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/heaps)
[ByteBuddy](https://bytebuddy.net/) and
[invokedynamic](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/understanding-java-method-invocation-with-invokedynamic)
to insert dynamically optimizable spots into a Java program.

### Lock-free programming

[Code](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/stacklock)

Technology:

- [<Abbr>MCS</Abbr> Locks](https://lwn.net/Articles/590243/)
- [<Abbr>TLA+</Abbr>](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/high-level-view.html)

I got heavily into lock-free programming for a while and
[played](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/stacklock) with making a
more efficient unfair lock implementation based on <Abbr>MCS</Abbr>
Locks that uses a stack instead of a queue. I also tried formalizing a
little bit of it in
[<Abbr>TLA+</Abbr>](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/high-level-view.html).

### Ada <Abbr>SPARK</Abbr>

[Code](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/linted/tree/master)

In the past I got into hard real-time and safety critical stuff for a
while. I
[experimented](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/linted/tree/master)
with breaking a program into separate processes some of which are
verifiable in a safe dialect of [Ada
<Abbr>SPARK</Abbr>](https://www.adacore.com/about-spark).

### Meditation

In <Time>2019</Time> I began seriously practicing meditation.  I
started with the book <Cite>Mindfulness in Plain English</Cite> by
Henepola Gunaratana which I recommend.  However, I do wish the book
had been even plainer.  I also recommend in investing in good padding.

### Poetry

[See This Blog](/blog/)

In <Time>2018</Time> I began a personal journey with poetry.  Most of
my <Time>2018</Time> work was not what I hoped.  However, over time I
got better. And overtime I found poetry helped me a lot in other ways.
