Common poetry markup is inaccessible, unsemantic and doesn't display
well. I am not skilled in accessibility and I don't have good
solutions.  See [<Cite>Try It</Cite>](#try-it) if you want to try out a screen
reader yourself.

**Special thanks to the kind people who helped edit this post.**

## Accessibility

The art of the spoken word is not accessible to the visually impaired.
Most markup navigates awkwardly, does not insert appropriate pauses
for breath, and mispronounces stress and sounds.  Consider
[<Cite>Markup A</Cite>](#markupa) and [<Cite>Markup
B</Cite>](#markupb).  In [<Cite>Markup A</Cite>](#markupa) a poem is
an ordered list of stanzas and stanzas are ordered lists of verses.
In [<Cite>Markup B</Cite>](#markupb) poems are sequences of stanzas,
stanzas are paragraphs and lines in a paragraph are separated by line
break elements.


```html id="markupa" title="Markup A"
<ol class="poem">
<li>
    <ol>
        <li>Roses are red</li>
        <li>Violets are blue,</li>
        <li>Sugar is sweet</li>
        <li>And so are you.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
</ol>
```

~~~ html id="markupb" title="Markup B"
<p class="stanza">Roses are red<br>
Violets are blue,<br>
Sugar is sweet<br>
And so are you.</p>
~~~

[<Cite>Markup A</Cite>](#markupa) is hard to navigate as each line in
an ordered list must be manually tracked through.  As well <q>line
<var>m</var> of <var>n</var></q> is repeated for every line of
[<Cite>Markup A</Cite>](#markupa).  You can use the `presentation`
<Abbr>ARIA</Abbr> role as in [<Cite>Markup A</Cite>](#markupa2) and [<Cite>Markup
A3</Cite>](#markupa3) to ameliorate the problem.  By the spec using
the `presentation` role in a list item for a list already marked with
a `presentation` role doesn't do much, but such markup can reduce
cruft in Firefox's accessibility inspector.

```html id="markupa2" title="Markup A2"
<ol class="poem">
<li>
    <ol role="presentation">
        <li role="presentation">Roses are red</li>
        <li role="presentation">Violets are blue,</li>
        <li role="presentation">Sugar is sweet</li>
        <li role="presentation">And so are you.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
</ol>
```

```html id="markupa3" title="Markup A3"
<ol class="poem" role="presentation">
<li>
    <ol role="presentation">
        <li role="presentation">Roses are red</li>
        <li role="presentation">Violets are blue,</li>
        <li role="presentation">Sugar is sweet</li>
        <li role="presentation">And so are you.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
</ol>
```

As a <i>nuclear</i> solution you can markup the text for graphical
display using the `graphic` role as in [<Cite>Markup
N</Cite>](#markupn).  I advise use of the ~~`aria-labelledby`~~
`aria-details` (2022-11-28) attribute instead of the `aria-label`
attribute here. `aria-label` has a tendency to work poorly with
newlines in text, is not usually translated by automated tools and
doesn't let you embed more markup as appropriate.

```html id="markupn" title="Markup N"
<figure>
<div role="img" aria-details="transcript">
<ol class="poem">
<li>
    <ol>
        <li>Roses are red</li>
        <li>Violets are blue,</li>
        <li>Sugar is sweet</li>
        <li>And so are you.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<figcaption id="transcript">
<p>Transcript for text to speech:</p>
<p>Roses are red ;
   Violets are blue,
   Sugar is sweet ;
   And so are you.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
```

In some setups [<Cite>Markup B</Cite>](#markupb) sounds yucky.  Ending
and starting words in separate lines like <i>red</i> and
<i>Violets</i> run together.  You might include extra punctuation
annotated with a screen-reader-only class as with [<Cite>Markup
B <Abbr>HTML</Abbr></Cite>](#markupb2) and [<Cite>Markup B <Abbr>CSS</Abbr></Cite>](#markupb3) to work around this issue.
However, on Firefox this hack breaks up lines into separate areas to
track through.

```html id="markupb2" title="Markup B HTML"
<p>Roses are red<span class="sr-only">; </span><br>
Violets are blue,<br>
Sugar is sweet<span class="sr-only">; </span><br>
And so are you.</p>
```

```css id="markupb3" title="Markup B CSS"
.sr-only {
   display: inline-block ;
   user-select: none ;
   font-size: 1px ;
   line-height: 1px ;
   color: transparent ;
}
```

No revisions of [<Cite>Markup A</Cite>](#markupa) or [<Cite>Markup B</Cite>](#markupb) ensure
proper pronunciation of stress and sounds.  Only American English is
likely to be pronounced correctly. To help, you can set the language
attribute for documents and poems as appropriate.  However, this is
not a complete solution.

As an anglophone Canadian author I set the language attribute for my
documents and poems to `en-CA`. However, this only helps with English
words and not with imports from other languages.  I don't know how to
help screen readers pronounce names of mythical figures.  You could
markup individual phrases like `<i lang="non">Sleipnir</i>` (old
Norse) and `<i lang="gem">Wotan</i>` (Germanic languages group) but
this particular markup doesn't help.

Semantically you might markup stress with emphasis with the `em`
element.  However, such markup is verbose and many screen readers
ignore elements like `em` because of the heavy unsemantic abuse of
such elements in the wider internet for presenting bold text.

Perhaps there might be some obscure Unicode diacritics for better
marking up the prosody but I have not explored this option.  I worry
that such glyphs might be pronounced in common screen readers as
something like <q>Unicode character 591</q>.

## Presentation

Laying out poetry on small formats is awkward.  In print the standard
layout for overlong lines is to align the first line ragged right and
all other lines ragged left.

You can approximate a poetry layout with a hanging indent layout
something like [<Cite>Indent <Abbr>CSS</Abbr></Cite>](#indentcss).  However, a
hanging indent layout is not really correct.

```css id="indentcss" title="Indent CSS"
.line {
   text-indent: -4ch ;
   margin-left: 4ch ;
}
```

You can approximate a poetry layout on the web by aligning every line
block to the left but aligning the last line of the text *within* the
line block to the right.  Something like [<Cite>Align Last
<Abbr>CSS</Abbr></Cite>](#alignlastcss) almost works for a poetry layout.  However,
even this layout fails when you overflow multiple lines.

```css id="alignlastcss" title="Align Last CSS"
.stanza {
   display: flex ;
   flex-direction: column ;
   align-items: start ;
}
.line {
   display: block ;
   text-align-last: end ;
}
```


[<Cite>Example Code</Cite>](#examplecode) is similar to the current
compromise I use on this site.

```html id="examplecode" title="Example Code"
<style>
#scope p {
   text-indent: 0 ;
   padding: 0 ;
}
#scope p > span {
   display: inline-block ;
   text-align-last: end ;
}
</style>
<div id="scope" lang="en-CA">
<p>
  <span>Roses are red</span><br>
  <span>Violets are blue</span><br>
  <span>Sugar is sweet</span><br>
  <span>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.</span>
</p>
</div>
```


## Conclusion

You should use the `audio` element to markup poetry.

## Try It

Personally I found Android TalkBack to be the easiest screen reader to
get started with. [The helpful <Cite>A11y Project</Cite>
blog](https://www.a11yproject.com) has a number of guides on getting
started with screen readers but they might be a little old.

## And One More Thing

As of this blog post, the [<Cite><Abbr>CSS</Abbr> Speech
Module</Cite>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-speech-1/) has never really
gone anywhere.  Perhaps in the future the `voice-stress`,
`voice-duration` (for long syllables), `voice-pitch` (for pitch
accent) and `pause` properties would solve these sort of accessibility
problems.
