title: "On Names"
---

This is an expansion on an
[answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4469969/239001) I gave a
while ago on [math.stackexchange.com](math.stackexchange.com).

In math and logic we use names a lot.  But often formal treatment of
names is very hand wavy.  I want to go into the details of names and
hopefully help some other confused people out a bit.

The most common mathematical foundations are set theories axiomized in
first order logic.  Propositional-logic is pretty simple to formalize
but adding names on top of propositional-logic is much more
complicated.

# What is propositional logic?

[Heyting Algebra](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Heyting+algebra).

Just a partially ordered set with some extra structure.

I will not bore you with too many details about basic propositional logic.

~~~ Coq
Inductive prop :=
| true
| false
| and (P Q: prop)
| or (P Q: prop)
| impl (P Q: prop).

Notation "⊤" := true.
Notation "⊥" := false.
Infix "∧" := and.
Infix "∨" := or.
Infix "→" := impl.

Reserved Infix "⊢" (at level 90).

Inductive entails: prop → prop → Prop :=
| entails_Reflexive: Reflexive entails
| entails_Transitive: Transitive entails

| tt {P}: P ⊢ ⊤
| fanout {P Q R}: P ⊢ Q → P ⊢ R → P ⊢ Q ∧ R
| π1 {P Q}: P ∧ Q ⊢ P
| π2 {P Q}: P ∧ Q ⊢ Q

| absurd {P}: ⊥ ⊢ P
| fanin {P Q R}: P ⊢ R → Q ⊢ R → P ∨ Q ⊢ R
| i1 {P Q}: P ⊢ P ∨ Q
| i2 {P Q}: Q ⊢ P ∨ Q
where "P ⊢ Q" := (entails P Q).
