I come home from school
"Did you get it done, son?" Pride evident in my pee-paw's eyes!
I head up stairs to my room
And sit down on my gamer chair
And all of a sudden - with a creak crack
I bend over double with a hunch in my back
My chrome shiny Mac - turns all red and black
My hands claw over spewing out lines of code
Coq, Forth and C, Lisp and Rust but no Swift for me
Late into the night, then days, my vision impaired
At a CRT haze my bifocals stared
My magnum opus complete
"Based " slipped past at last I could admit
