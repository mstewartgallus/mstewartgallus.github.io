<p>My name is Silk and I am a hamster. I am a woman and I have pale cream
colored fur. Being a hamster I am a solitary sort but I actually like
my owner. The only thing is I wish my owner and her lover wouldn’t
have such loud and annoying sex.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard a woman scream <q>scootaloo</q> during an orgasm? Or
hear your owner poke her lover’s tits for ten minutes straight saying
beep, boop, beep boop?</p>

<p>Today I was curled up in my little coconut shell closet nibbling on a
lightly fermented pumpkin seed while my owner and her lover were
having dinner. They were having spaghetti with ground beef. I had a
craving for mealworms but all I had were seeds.</p>

<p><q>Quick cover Silk’s eyes</q> my owner yelled and I knew I was in trouble.</p>

<p>A quick peek out of my hut and it seemed as if my owner had spilled
spaghetti across her lover’s prodigious chest but in the process of
mopping things up had entangled themselves onto the floor. Whereupon
my owner’s lover proceeded to mime playing a guitar while stroking my
owner’s clit.</p>

<p><q>rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum</q> my owner sung to the tune of
<q>Little Drummer Boy</q> while miming playing bongos with her lover’s
chest.</p>
