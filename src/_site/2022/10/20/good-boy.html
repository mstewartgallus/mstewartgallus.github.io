<p>I was flush with good boy points from a recent contract with mama so I
decided to treat myself. Mama said if I do well with a practice gf I
could even get a real girl sometime!</p>

<p>Chrome display cryocases of black hoodied models lined the room.</p>

<p>At the depot running the counter was a lateshit twinkhon sales model
in a black suit. I estimated about two more years of viable use. One
more year if used roughly.</p>

<p><q>We have a wide variety of models available dear</q></p>

<p><q>I don’t care. I want a youngshit <abbr>BDD</abbr> passoid boymoder!</q></p>

<p><q>Quite the popular option lately but have you considered other
models?  The lateshit gigahon roastie has quite a dedicated
following.</q></p>

<p><q>I want a smol <abbr>PP</abbr> girl boymoder not a toastie roastie!</q></p>

<p><q>Not every <abbr>BDD</abbr> passoid is a youngshit you know? We have
quite a few luckshit twinkhon futchboys waiting for a good home. How
many good boy points do you even have dear? You’re looking for quite
the expensive option you know?</q></p>

<p>I leaned my big boned man padding over the counter.</p>

<p><q>I want a <abbr>BDD</abbr> boymoder passoid small <abbr>PP</abbr>
girl</q> I said through gritted teeth.</p>

<p>Omae was getting unwise.</p>

<p>I pulled out a bag of McDonald’s takeout from my voluminous
trenchcoat. All around the room models in their cryocases turned their
heads to look.</p>

<p><q>Oh honey, you’re a big boy! You wouldn’t dare cause an incident would
you?</q></p>

<p><q>You try me and these chicken nuggies show just how much of a big boy
I am</q></p>
