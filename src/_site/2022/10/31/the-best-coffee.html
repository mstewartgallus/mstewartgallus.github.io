<p>The best coffee in Vancouver is a matter of taste. However, the best
coffee per dollar is objective fact.</p>

<p>The problem with chain fast food coffee is not poor quality but rather
inconsistency.  Despite guidelines otherwise I assume it is likely
many coffee machines are unwashed for days or many pots of coffee are
kept stale on warm for hours.</p>

<p>So timing and location are key. Depending on the shift and the volume
of customers you may or may not obtain a fresh cup of coffee. Never
order decaf. I assume the employees must spit it in it or something.</p>

<p>The other side of coffee is psychological and internal to the
self. Coffee can be tough on the stomach and should be consumed in
small quantities along with a small amount of some bread stuff. But
moreover, time of day and relative thirst or hunger plays a role as
well.  The best coffee is consumed early in the morning along with the
thick fog of a headache.</p>

<p>Setting and weather are critical as well. The best coffee is drunk in
a warm comfortable quiet place and at the same time under an umbrella
during the rain in a park. Both are key ingredients. The best coffee
requires walking.</p>

<p>There are a few locations in Vancouver near a nice park and near a
quiet place with good internet access like a public library. Some
pleasant locations to look around from include the central library and
the sea wall.</p>

<p>Unfortunately such matters are also predicated on time. Nothing is
constant and especially not coffee. Coffee is more of a feel or matter
of experience for certain locations and times than for research.</p>

<p>I will not share my favorite locations. Small grimy places, a few
chains, a few hipster places you can look up on any review blog of
coffee in Vancouver. I do not want you to spoil the atmosphere and I
hate you and wish you a bad day.</p>

<p>If you really must try circling out from some skate parks or
underneath highway overpasses.</p>
