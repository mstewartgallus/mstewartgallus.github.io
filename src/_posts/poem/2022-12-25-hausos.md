{% poem %}
As the dawn sun over waves
crashing upon the shore.
As lovely as a love goddess
ten times more.
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
She threw me with a kiss.
She struck me with a dart.
Music of the harp
arrows&thinsp;---&thinsp;that do no harm&thinsp;---&thinsp;sting the heart.

I set my heart in a ship of stone.
I enter a deep and dreamless sleep.
And over the floor I creep
twisting and turning and winding and burning.
{% endpoem %}
