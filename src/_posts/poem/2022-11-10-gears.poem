Ceaseless pacing ⁠— close behind
Gears colliding clash and ⁠— grind
In the ⁠— factory they dance and screach
Haephestus hand ⁠— mother, machine and man

Words become javelins of ⁠— war
Hermes⁠—Thoth no ⁠— angel anymore
The ⁠— industrial disease of men
⁠— Behold the rape of ink and pen

Words at war with ⁠— mind become the demon tyrant of mankind
