Tired, hot&thinsp;—&thinsp;both my arms and more
Wheels in my head&thinsp;—&thinsp;unbalanced turning
My nose and nasal tunnels&thinsp;—&thinsp;itchy, sore
Dry throat&thinsp;—&thinsp;cracked and burning

My poor stomach&thinsp;—&thinsp;rolling, churning
Hot, ugly&thinsp;—&thinsp;a fever in my head
I should have stayed in bed
