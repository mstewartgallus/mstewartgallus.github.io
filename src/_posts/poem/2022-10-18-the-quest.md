{% poem %}
war lost, Two was exiled and turned to banditry
where he assailed souls from all sides
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
till one day dreaming Two's heart rose up
and sleeping in a cave he had a dream

lift up, take up, stand up, young son, lost one, lost son

go seek the ring&#x2009;---&#x2009;find the cup, rise up young son
you live today&#x2009;---&#x2009;your heart beats still&#x2009;---&#x2009;and still sings on

for none can harm but what you sing, the heart you give
for bliss or ill this is your life

and you choose how your story ends&#x2009;---&#x2009;not the knife
for hell or heaven, judgement day or angel's song 

no prison gate nor plague nor pain shall bar
the mercy of the court&#x2009;---&#x2009;stands uncontested

Two find the cup and ring, the treasure that I sing
and keep on&#x2009;---&#x2009;and on and on, for me, for you

all men die, all churches crumble&#x2009;---&#x2009;all this shall fall
the weight and measure of so much dross&#x2009;---&#x2009;this all 

just heart and soul&#x2009;---&#x2009;song and word and breath redeem
the weighty load you carry, wealth or burning coal

all sorrow then&#x2009;---&#x2009;just dust of men, thunder
the beating of the heart and&#x2009;---&#x2009;the singing soul
{% endpoem %}
