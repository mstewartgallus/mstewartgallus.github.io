{% poem %}
in a land of purple sands&thinsp;—&thinsp;a glasswork city grew
cathedrals of stained glass&thinsp;—&thinsp;and a likewise people too
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
from the land the Glassmen sprung&thinsp;—&thinsp;as flowers from the earth
linked as one&thinsp;—&thinsp;one people all from birth

such was this race of men&thinsp;—&thinsp;that none could hate or condemn
and no one could suffer ill&thinsp;—&thinsp;for death would the killer kill

and of this strangest race&thinsp;—&thinsp;they had no need for face or tongue
for each and all saw alike&thinsp;—&thinsp;as through glass&thinsp;—&thinsp;the one

to the city she brought&thinsp;—&thinsp;strange coins, strange eyes
strange clothing, tantalizing hips and thighs

a stranger wandered in&thinsp;—&thinsp;she had a voice you could not know
a heart they could not recall&thinsp;—&thinsp;and so much blood
{% endpoem %}
