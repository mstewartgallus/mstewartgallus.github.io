{% poem %}
in a land of purple sands&#x2009;---&#x2009;a glasswork city grew
cathedrals of stained glass&#x2009;---&#x2009;and a likewise people too
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
from the land the Glassmen sprung&#x2009;---&#x2009;as flowers from the earth
linked as one&#x2009;---&#x2009;one people all from birth

such was this race of men&#x2009;---&#x2009;that none could hate or condemn
and no one could suffer ill&#x2009;---&#x2009;for death would the killer kill

and of this strangest race&#x2009;---&#x2009;they had no need for face or tongue
for each and all saw alike&#x2009;---&#x2009;as through glass&#x2009;---&#x2009;the one

to the city she brought&#x2009;---&#x2009;strange coins, strange eyes
strange clothing, tantalizing hips and thighs

a stranger wandered in&#x2009;---&#x2009;she had a voice you could not know
a heart they could not recall&#x2009;---&#x2009;and so much blood
{% endpoem %}
