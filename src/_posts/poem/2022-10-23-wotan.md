{% poem %}
Of those all&#x2009;---&#x2009;that Wotan call, number in good homeless men
to Valhalla they go&#x2009;---&#x2009;was one-eye I know&#x2009;---&#x2009;a hobo they ken
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
For too many of hobos have talking heads
And starved nine days without bread

Have you slept in the rain? 'Neath a tree?
I'll show you the runes&#x2009;---&#x2009;the triangle hands

And all hobo's of old&#x2009;---&#x2009;the railroad rode
You think Sleipnir was fast as the line?

And a Norse god of old&#x2009;---&#x2009;should know how to drink
So who would you have?&#x2009;---&#x2009;The drunk or the erg'?

For a thief and a king&#x2009;---&#x2009;a warrior's dirge!
{% endpoem %}
