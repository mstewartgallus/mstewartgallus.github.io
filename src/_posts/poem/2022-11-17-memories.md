{% poem %}
I feel nostalgic for
The warmth of&#x2009;---&#x2009;the hospital bed
The cold wet quiet&#x2009;---&#x2009;of fresh snow
And other memories from long ago
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
I remember
The chocolate sandwiched ice cream bar
Cheap freezies&#x2009;---&#x2009;in elementary school
A long yellow slide down
Falling asleep to the rain outside

Masturbation in the dark
Things in the bath
And other things of that nature
{% endpoem %}
