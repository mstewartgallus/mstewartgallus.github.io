{% poem %}
Ceaseless pacing ‖ close behind
Gears colliding clash and ‖ grind
In the ‖ factory they dance and screech
Haephestus hand ‖ mother, machine and man
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
Words become javelins of ‖ war
Hermes-Thoth no ‖ angel anymore
The ‖ industrial disease of men
 ‖ Behold the rape of ink and pen

Words at war with ‖ mind become the demon tyrant of mankind
{% endpoem %}
