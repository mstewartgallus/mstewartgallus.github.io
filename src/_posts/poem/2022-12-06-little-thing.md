{% poem %}
A small thing sat in the dirt
legs splayed, hands by its sides.
<q>I am tall</q> it said
and stood to prove its point.
{% endpoem %}

{% poem %}
Nothing but the sky around
so vast the earth surround.
could hear and scarcely see
the little speck.

The sky knelt a little lower
to observe this would-be challenger.
<q>I am small but I am strong</q>
so the little thing would amend.
{% endpoem %}
