{% poem %}
Give me a wish ‖ and I will wish you well
I will give you ‖ a magic spell
I'm in a mood, rather wicked
I seek death ‖ or something like it
Give me your spite
And I will write
Vicious murder, black shit ‖ of Brigid's womb
I will bring a man ‖ to his tomb
Dead things know ‖ buried passions, wrath and thirst
I am the font ‖ Pluto's curse
Liquid of the Mnemosyne
Drink and dream
And all ugly things in your sight
Bitter words I will write
{% endpoem %}
