Day 8 of no coffee, captains log

My body boils like a bubbling pot of pastrami noodles. The wet red
meat mess gravy of my brain congeals over the stove top. I am frying
eggs sunnyside up.  I close my eyes and aeons pass. I open my eyes and
it is another world.  I remember Tuesday fondly.

My head a pounding agony lying trapped beneath the embrace of my
oneitis and enfolded in the choking intoxication of a vape fiend's
addiction in a closet sized apartment.

I sequester protein sequences deep inside my intestine. The warm wet
egg yolk dirtying my fine trimmed facial hair. Breakfast as usual is a
tense quiet affair.  We are not hopeful today.
