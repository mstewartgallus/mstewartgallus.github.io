- be me
- be born in Vancouver
- high cost of living
- dirt poor
- second son of the family
- my dad was a failed starving artist
- my mother worked at data entry at a bank
- she was fat with a broken back
- and at home they didn't do much but eat and watch TV
- I mostly grew up alone on books and the computer
- at school I was never really bullied
- I'd come home and my parents would ask
- Were you bullied today at school?
- Nothing happened at school
- I just hid behind the back at lunch and did nothing
- all of my life just nothing
- I got a job below my skills and paid my way through college
- but the rage ate away at me
- I would walk along the streets for hours
- just walking away the rage
- I had violent and suicidal and sexual and jealous thoughts
- I began to suffer at college
- I sat in a haze at the library through exams for courses I hadn't been to all semester
- but I pushed through
- I got an Associate's Degree in CS
- I worked part time 10 hours a week
- barely
- are a job that didn't really use my skills
- at night I would feel like I was choking on the smell of burning garbage
- so I would go for long walks
- I started writing poetry
- just sitting at the library and writing poetry all day
- I developed weird pains through out my body
- I always had body issues
- and when I was 24 I got badly sunburned
- I freaked out and went to the emergency room
- fully convinced I was dying of skin cancer
- I kept going on in a fog
- in pain and suicidal everyday
- I was convinced my face was swelling up oddly
- it was round about a year after that
- I began meditating
- and it really saved my life
- I became really accomplished
- I meditated a lot
- I had to because I was in so much pain
- but soon the choking rage came back
- eventually I bought a skirt
- and it was when I put it on I had to admit I was trans

There's no conclusion here except maybe things didn't have to be like
this and you don't really know what handicaps people are struggling
with just by looking at their skin or apparent gender and I don't
really believe in bad guys and punishment anymore. When you've been to
that point where you're a danger to yourself and others you know it's
already punishment enough.

Things are getting better. I'm working more. I hope I'll be able to
get a job making real use of my coding skills eventually.
