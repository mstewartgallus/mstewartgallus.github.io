<q>Any peanut allergies?</q> I say.

<q>It's a mild anxiolytic.  The sesame seed oil suspension can cause
an allergic reaction</q> I explain.

<q>It calms nerves</q> I say to the blank stare of the frightened
woman in front of me.  It also was an amnestic although she didn't
need to know that.

<q>We think you were mugged</q>.  We being the cleanup crew who
handled things after an incident was over.

I pull out a pen light and check her eyes for a concussion.

<q>Damnit what's first aid?</q> I don't say out loud.

I phone up a local taxi company in front of the woman.  I hold her
hand and wait with her for 15 minutes or so.  Luckily, we were in the
downtown core.

<q>Fucking cowboys.</q>

Later, I drink some tea at a coffee shop and decompress a bit.  I had
time to kill before the site director arrived for an interview.
Maybe, I could get a bit of sugar and caffeine in.  I haven't slept
for two nights so I needed the kick.

I browse social media for half an hour and nibble on a chocolate chip
cookie.  I put my phone on <q>do not disturb.</q> My coworkers are
spamming the company chat with the usual garbage.

I begin to plot the murder of my supervisor.
