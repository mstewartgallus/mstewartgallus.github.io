So I was idly browsing social media and hugging my blahaj in bed when
I saw my mutuals' post doing numbers on gacc/gock.

gacc/gock

The social media app for transbians by transbians. Clone an existing
app but for a niche subgroup like college students or mentally ill men
in dresses. Then expand. Or given the predilections of those on the
platform inflate.

The eternal recurrence. If a demon appeared before you and told you
<q>all that was shall be again</q> would you cringe or declare
yourself a God? The Nietzschean ubermensch is here and she is a
lolcow.

So I was staring at a time lapse of my friend's supernumerary butt
hole, an abscess drained last month ago. I suppose this was what
Zhaungzhi meant by the pipes of heaven and earth. I had sworn a blood
oath to stay off the chats but I suppose one little peek couldn't
hurt. The familiar cacophony overcame me as a vortex of fuck sucked me
in.

Typically I used a katana but the current meta favored a Mosin
Nagant. The dueling subprogram of the network was old, elegant and
endlessly broken. The latest patches only try to contain the worst of
the chaos. I should know as the maintainer.

The easiest way to find information is to get dirty. I hit the streets
and greedily scarfed down the cigarette butts and needles littered
about. Hey it's VR they're just bytes! Gradually I picked up an acrid
trail.

Amongst the usual forums I found a black mass with a leaking
stoma. Wendigo. I walked in chewing on one last cigarette butt.

<q>Hey it's a genuine exploit!</q> I explained. <q>They never intended
you to use cigarettes like this so it leaks metadata like crazy.</q>

I took another drink of coffee. It didn't wash the taste out of my
mouth but it helped to pretend it did.

Anon noted <q>uhuh I understood a bit of that.</q>
